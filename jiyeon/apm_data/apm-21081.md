INTRODUCTION\n\nFor decades, there has been a quest to look out for a reli-\nable and efficacious premedication to allay anxiety and fear\nof the stressful preoperative period. The leading factors\ncontributing to preoperative anxiety in pediatric patients\nare parental separation, fear of doctors, needle injections,\nlimited understanding of the nature of the illness, and the\nneed for surgery [1]. Preoperative anxiety and stress re-\nsponses are responsible for the activation of the sympathet-\nic, parasympathetic, and endocrine systems. Children are\nlikely to develop adverse clinical outcomes such as postop-\nerative psychological trauma, emergence delirium, changes\nin sleep patterns, and aggression [2,3]. The reduction in\npreoperative anxiety and distress in children is not only an\nethical imperative but also helpful in minimizing postoper-\native behavioral problems with the aid of a suitable pre-\nmedication.\n\nAn ideal premedication drug should result in a sedated\nchild to allow easy separation of a child from the parents,\nfacilitating smooth induction of anesthesia and a pleasant\nperioperative experience for both children and parents. Al-\nthough many studies have reported the effects of benzodi-\nazepines, a-2 agonists, opioids, and ketamine as premedi-\ncation drugs via various routes, there is no widely accepted\ndrug or route of choice [4-6]. Most of these drugs produce\nvariable sedation, with a risk of respiratory depression.\nStudies have reported higher bioavailability and fewer ad-\nverse events with the nebulized route than with oral or in-\ntranasal administration [7-10].\n\nA few studies were available in the literature that com-\npared the nebulized dexmedetomidine and ketamine as a\npremedication in pediatric patients undergoing inguinal\nhernia surgery under general anesthesia [11-13]. The hy-\npothesis of this study was that nebulized dexmedetomidine\nand ketamine as premedications are equally effective in\nterms of sedation at 30 min in pediatric patients. The pri-\nmary objective of this study was to assess the level of seda-\ntion achieved after 30 min of nebulization and to compare\nbetween the two groups, and the secondary objectives were\nparental separation anxiety scale, mask acceptance scale,\nrecovery time, emergence agitation, hemodynamic chang-\nes, and adverse effects.\n\n# MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n# Study design\n\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Com-\nmittee (no. SNMC/IEC/2019/Plan/180) and registered at the\nClinical Trial Registry of India (no. CTRI/2019/11/022270)\nbefore the commencement of the study. This clinical study\nwas performed in accordance with the ethical principles for\nmedical research involving human subjects outlined in the\nHelsinki Declaration of 1975 (revised 2013). This prospec-\ntive, randomized study was conducted at a tertiary care\nteaching hospital between December 2019 and November\n2020, after obtaining written informed consent from the par-\nents or guardians. Preoperative evaluation of all patients was\ncarried out one day before the scheduled surgery.\n\nStudy population and interventions\n\n1. Participants and eligibility\n\nA total of 70 patients, aged 2-8 years of both sexes, Ameri-\ncan Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II, who\nunderwent hernia repair surgery under general anesthesia\n(surgical duration less than 60 min), were enrolled in this\nstudy.\n\n2. Exclusion criteria\n\nPatients with known allergy to the study drug, upper respi-\nratory tract infection, any nasal disorders such as recurrent\nnasal bleed or nasal masses, or congenital heart disease,\nchildren with increased intracranial pressure/intraocular\npressure, and children with any psychiatric illness were ex-\ncluded from the study.\n\n3. Primary objective\n\nThe primary objective ofthe study was to examine the lev-\nel of sedation achieved at 30 min using the Ramsay sedation\nscale (RSS).\n\n4. Secondary objectives\n\nThe secondary objectives were parental separation anxi-\nety scale, acceptance of the mask, hemodynamic variables,\nrecovery time, incidence of emergence agitation, and ad-\nverse events.\n\n5. Randomization\n\nPatients were randomly divided into group D (nebulized dexmedetomidine 2 �g/kg, 35 patients) and group K (nebu-\nlized ketamine, 2 mg/kg, 35 patients) using a computer-gen-\nerated random number table.\n\n6. Allocation concealment\n\nThe group concealment was performed with a sealed\nopaque envelope by an independent investigator who was\nnot involved in the study. The envelope was opened imme-\ndiately after the arrival of a child in the preoperative holding\narea. The drug solution was prepared by an anesthesiologist,\nwho was not involved in the observation or administration\nof the drug in identical syringes with matching random\ncodes. The study drug was diluted in 4 ml by adding 0.9%\nnormal saline in both groups.\n\n7. Blinding\n\nThe observers, attending anesthesiologists, and data col-\nlectors were blinded to the drug being administered.\n\n8. Monitoring\n\nStandard American Society of Anesthesiologists monitors\nsuch as an electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure,\nand pulse oximetry were applied, and baseline heart rate\n(HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure,\nmean arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate, and peripher-\nal oxygen saturation were recorded.\n\n9. Intervention\n\nThe study drug was administered by a standard hospital\njet nebulizer (Romsons Aero Neb nebulizer cup and mask\nset, Romsons Scientific & Surgical Pvt. Ltd., India) with an\noxygen flow of 6 L/min over 10 to 15 min. Nebulization was\nstopped when the nebulizer started to sputter.\n\n# Outcomes\n\nThe sedation scale was assessed using the RSS immedi-\nately after completion of drug administration (0 min) and\nevery 5 min for 30 min. A score of 3 or 4 was considered ac-\nceptable for sedation (Table 1. Ramsay Sedation Scale\n\n- 1 Patient is anxious and agitated or restless, or both\n- 2 Patient is cooperative, oriented, and tranquil\n- 3 Patient responds to commands only\n- 4 Patient exhibits brisk response to light glabellar tap or loud au-\n- ditory stimulus\n- 5 Patient exhibits a sluggish response to light glabellar tap or\n- loud auditory stimulus\n- 6 Patient exhibits no response) [14].\n\nParental separation was assessed 30 min after completion\nof study drug administration using a four-point parental\nseparation anxiety scale (PSAS) (1 = excellent, easy separa-\ntion; 2 = good, whimpers, but is easily reassured, not cling-\ning; 3 = fair, cries and cannot be easily reassured, but not\nclinging to parents; and 4 = poor, crying, and clinging to\nparents) [15]. PSAS scores of 1 and 2 were considered ac-\n\nceptable separation, while scores of3 and 4 were considered\ndifficult separation.\n\nPatients' acceptance was assessed 30 min after comple-\ntion of study drug administration by mask acceptance scale\n(MAS) (1 = excellent, unafraid, cooperative, accepts mask\neasily; 2 = good, slight fear of mask, easily assured; 3 = fair,\nmoderate fear of mask, not calmed with reassurance; 4 =\npoor, terrified, crying, or combative) [15]. The MAS scores of\n1 and 2 denote \"satisfactory\" mask acceptance, whereas\nscores of3 and 4 were considered \"unsatisfactory.\"\n\nHemodynamic parameters were recorded after completion\nofdrug administration (0 min) and every 5 min for 30 min.\n\nAnesthesia technique\n\nAnesthesia was induced with 100% oxygen and sevoflu-\nrane 8% with the help of a face mask. After loss of conscious-\nness, an intravenous line was secured on the dorsum of the\nhand, and fentanyl 2 �g/kg intravenously (IV) was adminis-\ntered. The airway was secured using an appropriately sized\nlaryngeal mask airway (LMA). Anesthesia was maintained\nby a minimum alveolar concentration of 1-1.2% of sevoflu-\nrane in a 50% oxygen/air mixture. Paracetamol (15 mg/kg\nIV) was administered to all patients before the completion of\nsurgery. Upon regaining consciousness, the LMA was re-\nmoved, and the patient shifted to the post-anesthesia care\nunit. Emergence agitation (EA) was assessed immediately\nafter removal of LMA (0 min) and every 5 min thereafter un-\ntil 30 min using the Watcha scale [16].\n\nAnesthesia time (from the time of the start of induction to\nthe time of discontinuation of sevoflurane), surgical time\n(from the time of incision to the application of last skin su-\nture), and recovery time (from the time of discontinuation of\nsevoflurane to the time the patient opened his/her eyes on\nverbal command) were recorded. A fall in HR < 70 beats/\nmin and a fall in SBP > 20% from basal level were consid-\nered bradycardia and hypotension, respectively, and man-aged accordingly.\n\nOther adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and hy-\npersalivation, were documented and managed according to\nthe standard protocol.\n\n# Sample size calculation\n\nThe sample size was calculated based on a previous study\n[11]. The proportion of patients who achieved adequate se-\ndation at 30 min after drug administration was 46% in the\ndexmedetomidine group and 13% in the ketamine group.\nConsidering 80% power and 95% confidence intervals, a\nminimum sample size of 30 children per study group was\nestimated. To round off and cover the possible dropouts, 35\nchildren in each group were included.\n\n# Statistical analysis\n\nThe data obtained were entered into a Microsoft spread-\nsheet and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sci-\nence (SPSS) version 24.0 (IBM Co., USA). The normal distri-\nbution of data was confirmed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. It\nshowed that our data were normally distributed, and thus,\nparametric tests have been used for statistical analysis. The\nunpaired Student t-test was used for quantitative variables\n(hemodynamic parameters), and the chi-square test (seda-\ntion level, PSAS) and Fisher exact test (emergence agitation,\nMAS) were used for qualitative variables. Continuous vari-\nables are expressed as mean 土 SD, and categorical data are\npresented as numbers and frequencies. A one-way repeated\nmeasures ANOVA was conducted to identify significant\nchanges in vital parameters at different time periods. Statis-\ntical significance was set at P < 0.05.\n\nRESULTS\n\nA total of 75 children were recruited for the trial. The par-\nents of two patients did not provide consent for participation\nin the study, and three patients with upper respiratory tract\ninfection were excluded from the study. The remaining 70\npatients were randomly divided into two equal groups of35\npatients each (Fig. 1 \nEnrollment Assessed for eligibility (n = 75)\nPatients aged 2 to 8 years of ASA PS I/II\nundergoing hernia repair surgery under general\nanaesthesia\nExcluded (n = 5)\n· Refused to participate (n = 2)\n· History of URTI (n = 3)\nRandomized (n = 70)\nAllocation\nAllocated to intervention (n = 35) Allocated to intervention (n = 35)\n· Received nebulized dexmedetomidine 2 �g per · Received nebulized ketamine 2 mg per kg in\nkg in total volume of 4 ml in normal saline total volume of 4 ml in normal saline\nFollow-Up\nLost to follow-up (n = 0) Lost to follow-up (n = 0)\nDiscontinued intervention (n = 0) Discontinued intervention (n = 0)\nAnalysis\nAnalysed (n = 35) Analysed (n = 35)\n· Excluded from analysis (n = 0) · Excluded from analysis (n = 0)\n\nFig. 1.

).\n\nBaseline hemodynamic parameters were comparable be-\ntween the groups. At 25 min and 30 min after premedication,\nthere was a statistically significant difference in the mean HR\n(P = 0.028, 0.011) between the two groups. Repeated mea-\nsures ANOVA showed a significant time effect in HR (Wilks'\nLambda = 0.395, P < 0.001) between groups (Fig. 3 \n- Chart Type: line\n|  | Baseline | 0 min | 5 min | 10 min | 15 min | 20 min | 25 min | 30 min |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| item_01 | 98mmHg | 102mmHg | 102mmHg | 101mmHg | 102mmHg | 96mmHg | 96mmHg | 102mmHg |\n\n\nFig. 3. Hemodynamic parameters (mean heart rate and mean systolic blood pressure) between groups. SBP: systolic blood pressure, HR:\nheart rate. Group D: dexmedetomidine group, Group K: ketamine group.). At 25\nmin and 30 min after premedication, there was a statistically\nsignificant difference in mean SBP (P = 0.025, 0.015). Re-\npeated measures ANOVA showed no significant time effect\nin SBP (Wilks' Lambda = 0.844, P < 0.384) between groups.\n\nIntraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic parame-\nters were comparable in both groups. None of the patients\nreported an episode of bradycardia or hypotension requir-\ning intervention in either group after premedication. Thirty\nminutes after removal of LMA, 2.8% of children in the dex-\nmedetomidine group and 8.5% of children in the ketamine\ngroup had EA. One patient in group D and two patients in\ngroup K complained of vomiting, and one patientin group K\nreported hypersalivation in the postoperative period.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe findings of this study were higher sedation scales\nachieved at 30 min, satisfactory parent child separation, and\nbetter mask acceptance in children premedicated with neb-\nulized dexmedetomidine compared to nebulized ketamine.\nMoreover, both drugs had comparable hemodynamics and\nincidence ofpostoperative agitation.\n\nAnxiolysis and smooth parental separation are important\ncomponents of pediatric preoperative preparation. Various\ndrugs, alone and in combination, via different routes were\nused. The nasal route of drug administration bypasses the\nenterohepatic circulation, which leads to better bioavail-\nability and avoids the bitter taste of the drug compared to\norally administered drugs. The atomizer used for nebuliza-\ntion creates small particulate forms of the drug, creating a\nthin layer around the buccal, nasal, and respiratory muco-\nsa [9]. The inhaled drugs administered through nebuliza-\ntion were comparatively more effective, quicker onset, and\nsafer than oral or intranasal routes for pediatric premedi-\ncation [8,9,11,12]. Dexmedetomidine acts on a-2 adrenergic receptors of the   locus coeruleus, resulting in quicker onset of sedation, mim-\nicking natural sleep with less respiratory depression. Simul-\ntaneously, dexmedetomidine sedation is characterized by\neasy arousability without affecting the orientation and coop-neration of the patient. The bioavailability of dexmedetomi-\ndine by non-intravenous routes, such as orogastric (16%),\nintranasal (65%), buccal (82%), and intramuscular (104%)\n[17-19].\n\nKetamine, a phencyclidine derivative, acts on the N-meth-yl-D-aspartate receptor and produces a state of dissociative\nanesthesia. Ketamine has been a popular drug for premedi-\ncation in pediatric patients administered through various\nroutes, but may result in excessive salivation, EA, or postop-\nerative nausea and vomiting [20]. The pharmacokinetic\nproperties of drugs administered through the nebulized\n\nroute are still being investigated.\n\nAt 30 min, the majority of children (16/35, 45.7%) in the\nnebulized dexmedetomidine group had an acceptable seda-\ntion scale of3, while only a few children (8/35, 22.8%) in the\nnebulized ketamine group had a sedation scale of 3. Similar\nresults were found in a study by Sabry et al. [13], although\nthey used higher doses compared to our study. They found\ncomparatively calm, sedated children with better mask ac-\nceptance and fewer respiratory complications in the group\nreceiving nebulized dexmedetomidine compared to the\nnebulized ketamine group and a mixture of nebulized ket-\namine and dexmedetomidine. This indicates that the dex-\nmedetomidine group provided better sedation than the ket-\namine group.\n\nIntranasal dexmedetomidine (2 �g/kg) was as effective as\nintranasal dexmedetomidine combined with ketamine (2\n�g/kg + 1 mg/kg) for sedation during transthoracic echocar-\ndiography, with shorter recovery and discharge times, al-\nthough the onset time was longer. The probable reason for\ndelayed recovery and prolonged hospital stay in the combi-\nnation group could be the excessive dose used for premedi-\ncation [21].\n\nHowever, both drugs have a different pharmacokinetic profile and their optimal dosage for combination to provide\nsynergistic action while minimizing hemodynamic pertur-\nbation, and delayed recovery has not been established yet\n[22]. Due to delayed recovery with combination therapy, a\nsingle drug was used for nebulization in this study. A similar\ndosage of dexmedetomidine and ketamine via nebulization\nhas been used in previous studies [11,12].\n\nIn this study, the PSAS was more satisfactory and MAS\nscores were higher in the dexmedetomidine group than in\nthe ketamine group. These findings were in accordance with\nthose of a previous study [11]. We also observed a decrease\nin HR and SBP from the baseline in the dexmedetomidine\ngroup due to the cardio-depressant effect, but slightly in-\ncreased HR and SBP from the baseline in the ketamine\ngroup due to sympathetic stimulant properties of ketamine.\nA statistically significant difference was observed in HR and\nSBP at 30 min between the two groups. However, hemody-\nnamic changes were clinically insignificant; hence, none of\nthe patients required corrective interventions. Comparable\nhemodynamics in both groups reflect the usage of a smaller\ndosage and slower absorption of the drug from the nebu-\n\nlized route; hence, the plasma concentration for producing\nadverse effects was not built up in the body. Previous studies\nalso demonstrated comparable hemodynamics with nebu-\nlized dexmedetomidine, ketamine, or a mixture of both as\npremedication in children [11-13].\n\nThe incidence of EA in pediatric patients ranges from 10\nto 60%. In our study, EA was comparable between the\ngroups. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis con-\ncluded that dexmedetomidine significantly decreased the\nincidence of post-anesthesia EA in pediatric patients com-\npared with placebo, midazolam, and opioids [23]. Similarly,\nNg et al. [24] also demonstrated the efficacy of ketamine in\nreducing EA in children undergoing surgery.\n\nThere are a few limitations to the present study. The serum\nconcentrations of dexmedetomidine and ketamine after neb-\nulization were not measured because of the lack of kits re-\nquired for assays. The bioavailability of drugs varies according\nto the route of administration, and further studies are required\nto determine the pharmacokinetics and optimal dosage of\nthese drugs administered through nebulization. Second, the\ntime of onset of sedation was not compared in the present study. Third, the scoring system used for the determination of\nparental separation and mask acceptance was not validated.\nLastly, the results of our study cannot be extrapolated for chil-\ndren younger than 2 years of age.\n\nDexmedetomidine nebulization had better, acceptable se-\ndation along with smooth separation from parents and had\nsatisfactory acceptance of face mask for induction of general\nanesthesia compared to nebulized ketamine. Moreover, they\nhad a similar profile for emergence agitation and the inci-\ndence of drug-related adverse reactions.
