In Europe,<br>rivaroxaban is also indicated for co-administration with acetyl-<br>salicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or<br>ticlopidine for the prevention of atherothrombotic events after<br>acute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers<br>[10]. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct inhibitors of Factor<br>Xa, whereas dabigatran is a direct inhibitor of thrombin.<br>All three agents have been found to exhibit predictable<br>pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and have a fast<br>onset of action-reaching maximum plasma concentration<br>rapidly after oral administration (apixaban, 3-4 hours; rivarox-<br>aban, 2-4 hours; dabigatran, 0.5-2.0 hours) [6,8,10,12-15].<br>The half-lives of apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran are<br>~12 hours, 5-13 hours, and 11-14 hours, respectively<br>[6,8,10]. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacody-<br>namic characteristics are not influenced to a clinically mean-<br>ingful extent by body weight, age, or gender, which<br>collectively indicate that these direct OACs can be given as<br>fixed dosing regimens without the need for routine coagulation<br>monitoring [16-20]. The routes of drug elimination differ be-<br>tween the 2 drug classes: apixaban and rivaroxaban have mul-<br>tiple pathways including renal excretion (~27% and 66%<br>[33% as active drug and 33% after metabolic degradation], re-<br>spectively), whereas elimination of dabigatran is predominant-<br>ly via the renal system (85%) [6,8,10,21]. In patients receiving<br>dabigatran for the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replace-<br>ment surgery, a dose reduction is required in those with mod-<br>erate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL min-1),<br>those aged 75 years or over, and those taking concomitant<br>mild-to-moderate P-glycoprotein inhibitors [8]. Owing to their<br>mode of action, all anticoagulants can increase the risk of<br>bleeding events. However, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabiga-<br>tran did not pose any significantly increased risk of major<br>bleeding events compared with enoxaparin in phase III clinical<br>trials in the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replacement<br>surgery [22-30]. Despite the clinical evidence on the safety<br>and efficacy profile ofdirect OACs demonstrated in clinical trials,<br>physicians- particularly anesthesiologists-need to be aware of<br>how to minimize the risks of bleeding complications when treat-<br>ing patients who are taking an anticoagulant and are due to under-<br>go surgery with regional anesthesia.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'21\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:14px\\'>Regional anesthesia techniques have become increasingly pop-<br>ular because they offer several benefits over general anesthesia and<br>traditional systemic analgesia, including reduced risk of mortality<br>and less postoperative pain, thus facilitating early postoperative<br>mobilization of the limbs and consequently reducing the chances<br>of postoperative VTE [31,32]. Regional anesthesia is used in<br>millions of operations each year and, at a time when the use<br>of the direct OACs is growing, bleeding-related complications<br>could arise if appropriate guidance is not followed [33]. This<br>review aims to provide anesthesiologists with an overview of<br>current data on the risk of hemorrhagic complications with<br>direct OACs when using regional anesthesia, particularly<br>in patients at a high risk of VTE, such as those undergoing<br>major orthopedic surgery.

Serious complications, such as<br>spinal or epidural hematoma and epidural abscess, are rare and<br>therefore difficult to study in detail [37].

However, the incidence of spinal hematoma<br>increases with the presence ofany risk factors, listed in Table 1,<br>and more so ifheparin anticoagulation is accompanied by trau-<br>matic puncture (increasing incidence rates to 1 in 2000 and 1<br>in 2900 for epidural and spinal anesthesia, respectively).

Of the 13 cases of neuraxial hematoma reported<br>from a total of 1.4 million procedures involving neuraxial<br>central blocks, 10 were associated with thromboprophylaxis<br>(enoxaparin, dalteparin, or fondaparinux); however, for<br>6 of 10 of these occurrences, the time elapsed between<br>cessation/initiation of thromboprophylaxis and puncture may<br>not have been sufficient to prevent a bleeding event [44]. A<br>recent retrospective study on the safety of epidural and spinal<br>neuraxial block showed that the incidence of perioperative<br>neurological complications in orthopedic patients was rela-<br>tively low (0.96/1000; 95% CI 0.77-1.16/1000), but was<br>higher than previously reported in other non-obstetric popula-<br>tions [45].

Patient-related factors increasing the risk of<br>spinal hematoma</p>\\n<p id=\\'37\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>Regarding patient-related factors, clinicians must exercise<br>particular care with elderly patients requiring surgical inter-<br>vention- these patients are at increased risk of thrombo-<br>embolic disorders [46,47] and are, therefore, more likely to<br>be receiving anticoagulants. Furthermore, the bleeding risk in<br>elderly patients receiving anticoagulants is augmented<br>[48,49]. Elderly patients are also more likely to have renal or he-<br>patic impairment, causing increased drug plasma concentrations,<br>and consequently drug elimination may be slower in these<br>patients [50]. Real-world data from the RIETE (Registro Infor-<br>matizado de Pacientes con Enfermedad TromboEmb�lica)<br>registry have shown major and fatal bleeding to be more com-<br>mon in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy who were<br>aged > 80 years compared with those aged <80 years (3.4%<br>vs 2.1% and 0.8% vs 0.4%, respectively) [51]. Therefore,<br>knowledge about the metabolism ofthe direct OACs approved<br>for VTE prevention after major orthopedic surgery is essential<br>when deciding which anticoagulant to prescribe to a particular<br>patient. Whereas the metabolism of dabigatran is mostly<br>dependent on renal clearance, the metabolism of apixaban<br>and rivaroxaban involves multiple pathways and is less<br>dependent on renal function (Table 2). The high frequency of<br>co-medication use in elderly patients also increases both the<br>potential for drug-drug interactions and the risk ofbleeding [52].</p>\\n<p id=\\'38\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:22px\\'>2.4.

The ecarin clotting time (ECT)<br>assay provides a direct measurement of the activity of dabiga-<br>tran, but is not readily available [71]. Calibrated ecarin chro-<br>mogenic assays are also available (eg, Ecarin Chromogenic<br>Assay, Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres-sur-Seine, France) and<br>may allow faster ECT measurements than the ECT assay<br>[71]. Direct thrombin inhibitor assays (such as the<br>HEMOCLOT assay, HYPHEN BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise,<br>France) can be used for the quantitative measurement of<br>plasma concentrations of dabigatran [81]. In the absence of<br>this assay, an aPTT test can be used [82].</p>\\n<p id=\\'100\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:22px\\'>5.

Assessment of neurological<br>function is the most reliable method for detecting neurological<br>injury, because standard laboratory tests may not provide ade-<br>quate information about the coagulation status of a patient<br>[83,84]. Monitoring of neurological function during regional<br>anesthesia alongside anticoagulant therapy is essential-but<br>may not be sufficient-to improve neurological outcomes.<br>Based on the pharmacokinetic properties of the direct OACs<br>and their rapid onset of action (within a few hours), confining<br>the assessment of neurological function to the period between<br>catheter removal or neuraxial puncture and 4 hours after<br>the initiation of therapy may seem reasonable. However, a<br>longer period of time during which neurological function<br>should be assessed may be required, because the development<br>of neurological injury may be slow, with the onset of<br>neurological symptoms potentially taking as long as 3 or more<br>days [55].</p>\\n<p id=\\'105\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>6.

The use of continuous peripheral nerve blocks (femoral<br>and lumbar plexus blocks) for hip and knee surgery may offer<br>advantages as a first strategy to balance the risk of hematoma<br>in anticoagulated patients compared with epidural analgesia.<br>The results from a systematic review ofrandomized controlled<br>trials support the use of peripheral nerve blocks as a first<br>choice of analgesia after major orthopedic surgery; femoral<br>nerve block provided a similar analgesic profile to epidural<br>analgesia, with fewer side-effects after total knee replacement sur-<br>gery [86]. Lumbar plexus block represents the first analgesic<br>choice after total hip replacement surgery [87]. However, both<br>lumbar plexus and femoral nerve blocks are still associated<br>with loss of quadricep muscle strength [88,89]. A study has<br>suggested that an adductor canal block after knee surgery<br>may provide a similar analgesic profile but without quadricep<br>weakness after total knee replacement surgery [88]. Although<br>no difference was observed between the 2 anesthesia tech-<br>niques in terms of morphine use or level of pain, quadricep<br>strength was significantly better preserved with an adductor<br>canal block than with a femoral nerve block (52% median of<br>baseline VS 18%, P = 004) [88]. Peripheral nerve blocks have<br>been associated with a potential for wound hematoma with<br>administration of heparin in some studies [57,90-93] but not<br>others [94]. The potential severity of a hematoma in a non-<br>compressible site and the lack of evidence on which to base<br>recommendations for the particular use of continuous periph-<br>eral nerve blocks have led the ESA and ASRA guidelines to<br>suggest expanding the clinical recommendations for neuraxial<br>anesthesia to deeper peripheral nerve blocks, such as lumbar<br>plexus [41,57].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'107\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:14px\\'>Studies specifically investigating the use of apixaban after<br>non-neuraxial blocks in orthopedic surgery seem to be lacking.<br>However, there are some available data for rivaroxaban<br>and dabigatran. In a prospective observational study of 504<br>patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery who had<br>continuous femoral nerve block and whose femoral catheter<br>was removed 20 hours after starting rivaroxaban (10 mg once<br>daily), no incidences of hematoma causing neurovascular<br>compromise at the femoral catheter site or groin area were<br>reported [95]. Neither was rivaroxaban associated with an<br>increase in major bleeding in an observational analysis of<br>766 patients undergoing total knee or hip replacement surgery<br>and femoral, sciatic, and lumbar plexus blocks, although 3<br>hematomas in the operated knee requiring surgical evacuation<br>were noted during rivaroxaban administration [96].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'108\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:14px\\'>In a post hoc pooled analysis of3 phase III clinical trials of<br>dabigatran (220 mg or 150 mg once daily) versus enoxaparin<br>for VTE prevention after knee or hip replacement surgery, in<br>which 19% (n = 1539) received a combination of general anes-<br>thesia or neuraxial anesthesia plus peripheral nerve block, rates<br>of major VTE and VTE-related mortality were slightly higher<br>with general anesthesia compared with neuraxial or combina-<br>tion anesthesia, although not significantly so, and neither were<br>there significant differences in efficacy or safety outcomes<br>between dabigatran and enoxaparin [63].</p>\\n<h1 id=\\'109\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>7. Conclusions</h1>\\n<p id=\\'110\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:14px\\'>Patients undergoing elective major orthopedic surgery<br>receive thromboprophylaxis because of their increased risk<br>of developing VTE. With the overall aging of the population,<br>more patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery are likely<br>to be receiving anticoagulation therapy for thromboembolic<br>disorders prior to their surgical procedure. Several direct<br>OACs are currently approved for different therapeutic indica-<br>tions, including prevention of VTE after elective knee or hip<br>replacement surgery, and their use in clinical practice has been<br>growing. Effective management of these direct OACs and<br>regional anesthesia is essential to avoid bleeding complica-<br>tions and is, therefore, a topic of crucial interest for anesthesi-<br>ologists. Thromboprophylaxis with all direct OACs may start<br>between 1 and 24 hours after surgery [6,8,10], provided that<br>hemostasis has been achieved, and thus should present a lower<br>theoretical risk of bleeding or neuraxial hematoma in case of<br>central blocks, in comparison with preoperatively initiated<br>LMWH. After surgery, restarting direct OACs can be delayed<br>by up to 48 hours in cases of bleeding or a difficult neuraxial<br>block, and protection against thromboembolic events is<br>achieved within hours after the first dose of these agents and<br>without the need for bridging therapy. The effect of the type<br>of anesthesia on clinical outcomes of the direct OACs is still<br>unclear. Subanalyses of RE-MODEL, RE-NOVATE, and<br>RE-MOBILIZE data suggest that, irrespective of the anesthe-<br>sia used, neuraxial anesthesia was associated with a lower risk</p>\\n<header id=\\'111\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>Anticoagulation and anesthesia</header>\\n<br><header id=\\'112\\' style=\\'font-size:16px\\'>233</header>\\n<p id=\\'113\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:14px\\'>of thromboembolic events and VTE-related mortality than<br>general anesthesia [63]. Conversely, a subanalysis of pooled<br>RECORD data found no significant difference in the risk of<br>venous thromboembolic events between these types of<br>anesthesia used [62]. A growing body of clinical study and<br>real-world data, particularly with rivaroxaban, suggests that<br>neuraxial anesthesia can be undertaken in patients undergoing<br>major orthopedic surgery without increasing the risk of<br>compressive hematoma, provided that guideline recommenda-<br>tions are followed and bleeding risk is evaluated on an individ-<br>ual basis.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\'114\\' style=\\'font-size:22px\\'>Acknowledgements</h1>\\n<p id=\\'115\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:16px\\'>The authors would like to acknowledge Li Wan for<br>editorial support, with funding from Bayer HealthCare<br>Pharmaceuticals and Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.</p>\\n<p id=\\'116\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>References</p>\\n<p id=\\'117\\' data-category=\\'list\\' style=\\'font-size:14px\\'>[1] Deitelzweig SB, Johnson BH, Lin J, Schulman KL.

In Europe,\\nrivaroxaban is also indicated for co-administration with acetyl-\\nsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or\\nticlopidine for the prevention of atherothrombotic events after\\nacute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers\\n[10]. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct inhibitors of Factor\\nXa, whereas dabigatran is a direct inhibitor of thrombin.\\nAll three agents have been found to exhibit predictable\\npharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and have a fast\\nonset of action-reaching maximum plasma concentration\\nrapidly after oral administration (apixaban, 3-4 hours; rivarox-\\naban, 2-4 hours; dabigatran, 0.5-2.0 hours) [6,8,10,12-15].\\nThe half-lives of apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran are\\n~12 hours, 5-13 hours, and 11-14 hours, respectively\\n[6,8,10]. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacody-\\nnamic characteristics are not influenced to a clinically mean-\\ningful extent by body weight, age, or gender, which\\ncollectively indicate that these direct OACs can be given as\\nfixed dosing regimens without the need for routine coagulation\\nmonitoring [16-20]. The routes of drug elimination differ be-\\ntween the 2 drug classes: apixaban and rivaroxaban have mul-\\ntiple pathways including renal excretion (~27% and 66%\\n[33% as active drug and 33% after metabolic degradation], re-\\nspectively), whereas elimination of dabigatran is predominant-\\nly via the renal system (85%) [6,8,10,21]. In patients receiving\\ndabigatran for the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replace-\\nment surgery, a dose reduction is required in those with mod-\\nerate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL min-1),\\nthose aged 75 years or over, and those taking concomitant\\nmild-to-moderate P-glycoprotein inhibitors [8]. Owing to their\\nmode of action, all anticoagulants can increase the risk of\\nbleeding events. However, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabiga-\\ntran did not pose any significantly increased risk of major\\nbleeding events compared with enoxaparin in phase III clinical\\ntrials in the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replacement\\nsurgery [22-30]. Despite the clinical evidence on the safety\\nand efficacy profile ofdirect OACs demonstrated in clinical trials,\\nphysicians- particularly anesthesiologists-need to be aware of\\nhow to minimize the risks of bleeding complications when treat-\\ning patients who are taking an anticoagulant and are due to under-\\ngo surgery with regional anesthesia.\\nRegional anesthesia techniques have become increasingly pop-\\nular because they offer several benefits over general anesthesia and\\ntraditional systemic analgesia, including reduced risk of mortality\\nand less postoperative pain, thus facilitating early postoperative\\nmobilization of the limbs and consequently reducing the chances\\nof postoperative VTE [31,32]. Regional anesthesia is used in\\nmillions of operations each year and, at a time when the use\\nof the direct OACs is growing, bleeding-related complications\\ncould arise if appropriate guidance is not followed [33]. This\\nreview aims to provide anesthesiologists with an overview of\\ncurrent data on the risk of hemorrhagic complications with\\ndirect OACs when using regional anesthesia, particularly\\nin patients at a high risk of VTE, such as those undergoing\\nmajor orthopedic surgery. Moreover, current guideline\\nrecommendations will be discussed and best practice in specific\\nclinical situations, such as in patients with renal impairment who\\nare at an increased risk of bleeding, will be highlighted.\\n2. Regional anesthesia and complications\\nThe most common complications of regional anesthesia\\ninclude postdural puncture headache (occurs in 0.1%-36% of\\npatients but rarely lasts longer than 7 days) [34], backache (af-\\nfects up to 11% of patients in the 5 days after the procedure)\\n[35], and peripheral nerve damage (eg, transient paresthesia\\nis estimated in up to 8%- 10% of patients in the immediate days\\nafter regional anesthesia) [36]. Serious complications, such as\\nspinal or epidural hematoma and epidural abscess, are rare and\\ntherefore difficult to study in detail [37]. For peripheral nerve\\nblock, neurological complications are extremely rare, ranging\\nbetween 0.02% and 0.04% [38,39].\\n2.1. Risk factors associated with regional anesthesia\\nIn a systematic review of 141 studies (n = 9559),\\nneuraxial anesthesia was shown to be associated with lower\\nrates of mortality (2.1% vs 3.1%; odds ratio [OR] 0.7; 95%\\nconfidence interval [CI] 0.54-0.90; P = .006), occurrence of\\nDVT (odds reduction of 44%; OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.43-0. 72;\\nP < .001) and PE (odds reduction of 55%; OR 0.45; 95% CI\\n0.29-0.69; P < .001), among other outcomes [31]. A more re-\\ncent observational study showed that neuraxial anesthesia was\\nassociated with a significantly reduced need for blood transfu-\\nsions compared with patients receiving general anesthesia\\n(28.5% vs 44. 7%; OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.45-0.61; P < .0001) af-\\nter simultaneous bilateral total knee replacement surgery [40].\\n2.2. Risk factors for the development of\\nspinal hematoma\\nThe overall incidences of hematoma in patients receiving\\nneuraxial anesthesia (epidural and spinal) have been estimated\\nto be as low as 1 in 220 000 and 1 in 320 000, respectively, in\\nthe absence of traumatic puncture and without the use ofhep-\\narin or ASA [41]. However, the incidence of spinal hematoma\\nincreases with the presence ofany risk factors, listed in Table 1,\\nand more so ifheparin anticoagulation is accompanied by trau-\\nmatic puncture (increasing incidence rates to 1 in 2000 and 1\\nin 2900 for epidural and spinal anesthesia, respectively). For\\nASA therapy the risk is 1 in 8500 and 1 in 12 000 for epidural\\nand spinal anesthesia, respectively [41,42]. An incidence of\\nbetween 1 in 1000 and 1 in 10 000 has been estimated for neur-\\naxial hematoma after central neural blockade in patients under-\\ngoing orthopedic procedures and receiving preoperative\\nthromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin [43]. A recent review\\nassessing spinal/epidural anesthesia complications in Finland\\nfrom 2000 to 2009 showed the risk of developing a serious\\ncomplication (defined as a potentially fatal event or an event\\nof over 1 year in duration, including epidural hematoma) after\\n226\\nG.

Of the 13 cases of neuraxial hematoma reported\\nfrom a total of 1.4 million procedures involving neuraxial\\ncentral blocks, 10 were associated with thromboprophylaxis\\n(enoxaparin, dalteparin, or fondaparinux); however, for\\n6 of 10 of these occurrences, the time elapsed between\\ncessation/initiation of thromboprophylaxis and puncture may\\nnot have been sufficient to prevent a bleeding event [44]. A\\nrecent retrospective study on the safety of epidural and spinal\\nneuraxial block showed that the incidence of perioperative\\nneurological complications in orthopedic patients was rela-\\ntively low (0.96/1000; 95% CI 0.77-1.16/1000), but was\\nhigher than previously reported in other non-obstetric popula-\\ntions [45]. Risk factors associated with an increased risk of\\nclinically significant bleeding causing spinal hematoma can\\nbe divided into patient-, drug-, and procedure-related catego-\\nries (Table 1).\\n2.3. Patient-related factors increasing the risk of\\nspinal hematoma\\nRegarding patient-related factors, clinicians must exercise\\nparticular care with elderly patients requiring surgical inter-\\nvention- these patients are at increased risk of thrombo-\\nembolic disorders [46,47] and are, therefore, more likely to\\nbe receiving anticoagulants. Furthermore, the bleeding risk in\\nelderly patients receiving anticoagulants is augmented\\n[48,49]. Elderly patients are also more likely to have renal or he-\\npatic impairment, causing increased drug plasma concentrations,\\nand consequently drug elimination may be slower in these\\npatients [50]. Real-world data from the RIETE (Registro Infor-\\nmatizado de Pacientes con Enfermedad TromboEmb�lica)\\nregistry have shown major and fatal bleeding to be more com-\\nmon in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy who were\\naged > 80 years compared with those aged <80 years (3.4%\\nvs 2.1% and 0.8% vs 0.4%, respectively) [51]. Therefore,\\nknowledge about the metabolism ofthe direct OACs approved\\nfor VTE prevention after major orthopedic surgery is essential\\nwhen deciding which anticoagulant to prescribe to a particular\\npatient. Whereas the metabolism of dabigatran is mostly\\ndependent on renal clearance, the metabolism of apixaban\\nand rivaroxaban involves multiple pathways and is less\\ndependent on renal function (Table 2). The high frequency of\\nco-medication use in elderly patients also increases both the\\npotential for drug-drug interactions and the risk ofbleeding [52].\\n2.4. Drug-related factors increasing the risk of\\nspinal hematoma\\nSome drug interactions of anticoagulants might increase the\\nrisk ofbleeding complications, including the risk of spinal hema-\\ntoma. The direct OACs have fewer drug-drug and drug-food\\nTable 2 Pharmacokinetic characteristics of direct oral anticoagulants as per their Summary ofProduct Characteristics [6,8,10]\\nApixaban Rivaroxaban Dabigatran\\n Bioavailability ~ 50% for doses up to 10 mg 80%-100% (for 10 mg dose and for 15 mg and 20 mg doses taken with food) ~ 7%\\n Time to peak activity 3-4 h 2-4 h 0.5-2.0 h\\n Half-life ~ 12 h 5-9 h (young individuals) to 11-13 h (elderly individuals) 11-14 h\\n Renal elimination ~27% 33% as active drug (direct renal excretion) and 33% after metabolic degradation 85%\\n Pharmacokinetic interactions Strong inhibitors/inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp Strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp; strong CYP3A4 inducers Strong P-gp inhibitors and inducers\\nCYP3A4 = cytochrome P450 3A4; P-gp = P-glycoprotein.\\nAnticoagulation and anesthesia\\n227\\ninteractions compared with vitamin K antagonists. The most\\nsignificant interactions are those of apixaban and rivaroxaban\\nwith systemic co-administration of strong inhibitors ofboth cyto-\\nchrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (such as the azole-\\nantimycotics ketoconazole and itraconazole and the HIV protease\\ninhibitor ritonavir), which is not recommended [6,10], and\\ndabigatran with amiodarone and verapamil that requires a\\nreduction in the daily dose [8]. For all 3 direct OACs, care\\nshould be taken when co-administering with non-steroidal\\nanti-inflammatory drugs, ASA, or platelet aggregation inhibi-\\ntors, which may increase bleeding risk [6,10].\\n2.5. Procedural-related factors increasing the risk of\\nspinal hematoma\\nThe risk of spinal hematoma has also been associated with\\nprocedural factors, including unintentional needle/catheter-\\nrelated mechanical damage of neural or vascular components\\nof the spine due to a difficult or traumatic spinal procedure\\n[53-55]. The patient characteristics also have an influence\\non procedure-related risk factors; for example, aging is associ-\\nated with skeletal degeneration that may make the anesthesia\\nprocedure technically more difficult [56].\\n3. Influence of anesthesia in patients receiving\\ndirect oral anticoagulants: evidence from\\nphase III clinical studies with a focus on\\nmajor orthopedic surgery\\nGiven the increasing utilization of direct OACs for the\\ntreatment and prevention of thromboembolic disorders, it is\\ncrucial to evaluate the risk of compressive hematoma and the\\nimpact on clinical outcomes when regional anesthesia is used.\\nTo discuss the effect ofregional anesthesia on the risk of com-\\npressive hematoma and bleeding risk, we searched PubMed\\nwith no date restrictions for phase III clinical trials comparing\\n'apixaban : 'rivaroxaban , or 'dabigatran' with 'standard of\\n,\\ncare'/'low molecular weight heparin' for 'VTE prevention'/\\n'thromboprophylaxis' after 'total knee or hip replacement\\nsurgery*/cknee or hip arthroplasty' and for studies investigating\\n'spinal hematoma' after 'regional anesthesia'.\\nIt is worth noting the risk of spinal hematoma with regional\\nanesthesia when receiving traditional anticoagulants. Vitamin\\nK antagonist therapy is a contraindication for neuraxial\\nanesthesia, owing to the high risk ofbleeding associated with\\ntherapeutic doses [57]. The risk of spinal hematoma in patients\\nreceiving low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) concomi-\\ntantly with epidural anesthesia is reported to be 1:6600 for\\nsingle-shot epidural and 1:3100 with an indwelling catheter\\nfor the LMWH dosage of 30 mg twice daily and 1:18 000\\nfor a 40 mg once-daily dosage [57,58]. There are fewer data\\nfor ASA, but it has been demonstrated that medical patients\\nreceiving daily doses above 100 mg are at increased risk of\\nhemorrhagic complications [59].\\nCentral nerve blocks have been classified as a high bleed-\\ning risk procedure owing to their rare but severe complication,\\neg, spinal-epidural hematoma [60,61]. Because of the absence\\nof evidence-based data, when neuraxial procedures are\\nperformed in these conditions, a systematic follow-up of these\\npatients and a heightened awareness ofbleeding complications\\nshould be observed.\\n3.1. Apixaban\\nStudies specifically designed to investigate the relationship\\nbetween anesthesia and spinal hematoma risk in patients\\nreceiving apixaban are lacking. However, phase III clinical\\ntrials comparing apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily) with subcuta-\\nneous enoxaparin (30 mg twice daily or 40 mg once daily)\\nfor VTE prevention after total knee or hip replacement surgery\\nfound that apixaban was as effective as or better than enoxa-\\nparin at reducing the risk of the composite of VTE or death\\nwith similar or lower rates of bleeding [22-24]. In these 3\\ntrials, 15.8% of patients randomized to apixaban had regional\\nanesthesia. Experience of apixaban use in the presence of\\nneuraxial blockade is limited and, according to its product label\\nand guidance from the European Society of Anaesthesiology\\n(ESA), should only be done with extreme caution [6,57].\\n3.2. Rivaroxaban\\nThe incidences of intraspinal bleeding or hemorrhagic\\npuncture were included under the definition for major bleed-\\ning used in the RECORD (REgulation of Coagulation in\\nORthopaedic surgery to prevent Deep vein thrombosis and\\npulmonary embolism) clinical trial program of rivaroxaban\\n[27,62]. A post hoc analysis assessed 12 729 randomized\\npatients in the pooled RECORD1-4 program undergoing elec-\\ntive total knee or hip replacement surgery for events related to\\nneuraxial anesthesia, such as neuraxial hematoma [62].\\nThromboprophylactic therapy was provided to patients as\\neither oral rivaroxaban (10 mg once daily, initiated 6-8 hours\\nafter surgery) or subcutaneous enoxaparin (40 mg once daily,\\nstarted 12 hours prior to surgery, or 30 mg twice daily, started\\n12-24 hours after surgery) [62]. Although 66% of patients\\n(safety population, n = 12 383) received neuraxial anesthesia\\n(9% of patients also received general anesthesia), only 1\\ncompressive hematoma after epidural catheter removal was\\nrecorded. This event occurred after elective total knee replace-\\nment surgery in a patient treated with enoxaparin, who was at\\nincreased risk ofbleeding as a result ofadvanced age and renal\\ninsufficiency. The patient was adequately managed with a\\nlaminectomy without further bleeding or neurological\\ncomplications [62]. The type of anesthesia (spinal with or\\nwithout general anesthesia, epidural, epidural with indwelling\\ncatheter, general or spinal with femoral block, or general\\nalone) had no influence on the rates of total venous thrombo-\\nembolic events, which were lower with rivaroxaban than with\\nstandard of care [62].\\n228\\nG. Cappelleri, A. Fanelli\\nIn the RECORD posthoc subanalysis, the incidence oftotal\\nvenous thromboembolic events (the composite of any DVT,\\nnon-fatal PE, and all-cause mortality) and safety profiles were\\nsimilar irrespective of the type of anesthesia used. Neuraxial\\nanesthesia was associated with a slightly lower rate of\\nsymptomatic thromboembolic events compared with general\\nanesthesia in patients undergoing elective total knee or hip\\nreplacement surgery [62]. However, available experience\\nusing rivaroxaban with neuraxial blockade remains limited,\\nand real risk is difficult to evaluate owing to the low incidences\\nof spinal and epidural hematoma in this setting. The ESA\\nguidelines, published before the completion of the relevant\\nRECORD subanalysis, recommend extreme caution when\\nusing rivaroxaban with neuraxial blockade [57]. The\\nAmerican Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine\\n(ASRA) guidelines for dabigatran, as well as rivaroxaban,\\nare still being evaluated. These guidelines do not provide\\ndetailed information for the management of anticoagulation\\nwith direct OACs owing to a lack of available information\\non block performance [41].\\n3.3. Dabigatran\\nAn analysis of the pooled population of patients from the\\nphase III RE-MODEL, RE-NOVATE, and RE-MOBILIZE\\nstudies who underwent major hip or knee replacement surgery\\nand received thromboprophylaxis with dabigatran (220 mg or\\n150 mg once daily) or enoxaparin showed a higher use ofneur-\\naxial anesthesia (n = 4212; 52%) compared with general anes-\\nthesia (n = 2311; 29%) or combination anesthesia, namely,\\nneuraxial or general anesthesia combined with a peripheral\\nnerve block (n = 1539; 19%) [63]. The use of neuraxial anes-\\nthesia was not associated with neuraxial hematoma-no cases\\nwere reported [63]. The efficacy and safety outcomes of the\\ndabigatran groups did not differ from those of the standard\\ntherapy groups, and were not significantly influenced by the\\ntype of anesthesia used [63]. A reduced incidence of major\\nVTE and VTE-related mortality was observed with neuraxial\\nanesthesia compared with general anesthesia (4.2% vs 3.1%;\\nOR 1.40; 95% CI 1.03-1.90; P = .035) in the overall population,\\nbut no significant differences or clear trends were recorded\\nregarding the safety outcomes of major bleeding or major\\nand non-major clinically relevant bleeding between the types\\nof anesthesia [63]. Experience with combined use of neuraxial\\nblockade and dabigatran is restricted by its manufacturer's\\nadvice against this, as stated by the ESA guidelines [8,57].\\n4. Management of direct oral anticoagulants and\\nneuraxial anesthesia in major orthopedic surgery\\nManagement strategies must balance the surgical risk of\\nhematoma in the anesthetized patient with effective thrombo-\\nprophylaxis. Understanding the pharmacodynamic and\\npharmacokinetic properties of an anticoagulant and the influ-\\nence ofpatient age and hepatic and renal function is essential.\\nProviding neuraxial anesthesia and the timing ofneedle/catheter\\ninsertion/removal in patients who are receiving or are to receive\\nanticoagulant therapy involves individual assessment of the\\nrisks and benefits of such a procedure, together with rigorous\\nmanagement of anticoagulation activity and monitoring for\\nsigns of neurological dysfunction. It is of the utmost importance\\nto ensure that the anticoagulation effect is adequately reduced\\nbefore proceeding with a neuraxial block. It is possible to\\nmeasure the effect of the direct OACs either qualitatively or\\nquantitatively, if required.\\n4.1. Perioperative management of direct\\noral anticoagulants\\nAdequate protocols for interrupting and resuming thrombo-\\nprophylaxis based on the pharmacokinetic properties ofthe direct\\nOACs are essential. Clinical practice guidelines, such as those of\\nthe ESA [57]), ASRA [41], and the Scandinavian Society of\\nAnaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (SSAI) [64], pro-\\nvide recommendations for the regional anesthetic management\\nof patients undergoing surgery and requiring anticoagulation,\\nincluding with direct OACs (Table 3). These recommenda-\\ntions, based on data from clinical trials, the pharmacokinetic\\nprofile of each anticoagulant, and from clinical experience, ad-\\nvise a waiting time between interrupting anticoagulation and\\nperforming neuraxial blockade that depends on the elimination\\nhalf-life of the anticoagulant agent [57]. The percentages of\\ndrug remaining in the circulation after 1-6 half-lives are\\n50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.3%, 3.1%, and 1.6%, respectively [65].\\nA recommendation for a waiting period of2 half-lives, to re-\\nduce the bioavailability of an anticoagulant to less than 25%,\\ndoes not take into consideration how the half-life elimination\\nof a drug is influenced by patient characteristics. Patients\\nwho undergo joint replacement surgery are typically elderly,\\noften with renal impairment and receiving antiplatelet therapy;\\nfor these patients, a waiting time of 3-5 half-lives could be\\nmore appropriate ifhemostatic safety is not assured (Table 4).\\nTo prevent VTE after major orthopedic surgery, the direct\\nOACs have to be administered in the postoperative period\\nwhen adequate hemostasis has been established, as determined\\nby the treating physician.\\nRecently, the direct OACs have been approved for long-term\\nprevention of thromboembolic events in non-valvular AF, and\\nfor the treatment and secondary prophylaxis of VTE. Every\\nyear, 15%-20% of patients receiving therapeutic doses of anti-\\ncoagulants require perioperative temporary interruption, and\\nthe characteristics ofboth the patients and the procedures should\\nbe considered when scheduling interruption and resumption.\\n4.1.1.

There is no clinical experience\\nwith the use of apixaban with indwelling intrathecal or epidu-\\nral catheters [6]. However, if required, the recommendation\\nprovided by the Summary ofProduct Characteristics is to wait\\n20-30 hours (considering 2 times its elimination half-life) be-\\ntween interruption of anticoagulation therapy and neuraxial\\npuncture/catheter removal, with at least 1 dose being omitted\\n[6,66]. The ESA recommends 26-30 hours between stopping\\nanticoagulation and conducting a neuraxial anesthesia proce-\\ndure for management of anticoagulation with apixaban in the\\ncontext of elective orthopedic surgery [57].\\n4.1.1.2. Resumption of apixaban after surgery. The Sum-\\nmary ofProduct Characteristics of apixaban recommends start-\\ning thromboprophylaxis 12-24 hours after the end of surgery,\\nprovided hemostasis is achieved and allowing for a waiting\\nperiod of at least 5 hours to re-initiate treatment after catheter\\nremoval [6]. The ESA recommends 4-6 hours between cathe-\\nter removal and initiation of anticoagulation, for management\\nof anticoagulation with apixaban in the context of elective\\northopedic surgery [57]. No further recommendations were\\nprovided by the ASRA for management of anticoagulation\\nwith apixaban in the context of elective orthopedic surgery\\n[41]. The SSAI guidelines state that the lack of data prevents\\nany recommendation being made regarding the use of apixa-\\nban and central neuraxial block, although a period of 6 hours\\nshould be observed between central neuraxial block or catheter\\nmanipulation and first dose of this anticoagulant [64].\\n4.1.2. Perioperative management of rivaroxaban\\n4.1.2.1. Interruption of rivaroxaban before surgery. The\\nSummary of Product Characteristics of rivaroxaban suggest\\nin patients with normal renal function a minimum of24 hours\\nbetween the last therapeutic dose of the anticoagulant and the\\nstart of the surgery [10]. For patients with severe renal impair-\\nment, many authors recommend an interval of up to 4-5 days\\n[60,67,68]. Imberti et al suggested a discontinuation of rivar-\\noxaban at least 48 hours prior to procedures involving a\\nstandard risk of bleeding, such as orthopedic surgery; for\\nprocedures with a high risk of bleeding (neuraxial block),\\nrivaroxaban should be stopped 72 hours before the intervention\\n[69]. In the authors' opinion, patients with AF with standard\\nbleeding risk (HAS-BLED score <3) could undergo neuraxial\\nanesthesia 48 hours after the last rivaroxaban intake, whereas\\nin patients with high bleeding risk, neuraxial anesthesia should\\nbe delayed for 4 days, and this type of anesthesia should not be\\nconsidered in cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine\\nclearance <30 mL min- 1) [69].\\nIn patients receiving ongoing rivaroxaban, ifa central block\\nwith an indwelling catheter is used, the SSAI guidelines\\nrecommend a minimum of 18 hours between the last dose of\\nrivaroxaban and removal of an indwelling catheter [64].\\nBecause of the prolongation ofthe half-life in elderly patients,\\nthe ESA guidelines recommend a longer interval (22-26 hours)\\nbetween the last dose of rivaroxaban and removal of an\\nindwelling catheter [57]. These 2 recommendations are in\\nagreement with those in the report by Rosencher et al, which\\nrecommends 2 half-lives between rivaroxaban discontinuation\\nand epidural catheter removal [66]. Furthermore, these guide-\\nlines highlight the fact that patients receiving anti-hemostatic\\ndrugs and with impaired drug elimination, such as those with\\nrenal impairment, may require waiting times to be prolonged\\n[64]. The ASRA guidelines issued for rivaroxaban recom-\\nmend a cautious approach owing to the lack of information\\non the specifics (needle placement or catheter management)\\nofblock performance and the prolonged half-life in elderly pa-\\ntients resulting from deterioration ofrenal function, even in the\\nabsence of any reported spinal hematoma [41].\\n4.1.2.2. Resumption of rivaroxaban after surgery. Rivar-\\noxaban should be started 6-10 hours after the end of surgery,\\nprovided hemostasis is achieved [10]. The SSAI guidelines\\nrecommend a minimum of 6 hours between central neuraxial\\nblock and initiation of rivaroxaban, or a delay of 24 hours if\\na traumatic puncture occurred during the performance of\\ncentral nerve block [10,64]. The ESA recommends an interval\\nTable 4 Half-lives of direct oral anticoagulant drugs and recommended interval between discontinuation and surgery or neuraxial procedure, set as 2-3 half-lives or 4-5 half-lives depending\\non the bleeding risk of the surgical procedure and the level of anticoagulant effect permitted at surgery [65,67,68].\\nDrug Variation of elimination half-life values (h) a [65] Bleeding risk of surgical procedure Anticoagulant residual effect at surgery\\n Low bleeding risk surgery (2-3 half-lives) [67] Days between last dose and surgery [67] High bleeding risk surgery (4-5 half-lives) [67] Days between last dose and surgery [67] Mild to moderate anticoagulant effect (2-3 half-lives) [68] Days between last dose and surgery [68] No or minimal anticoagulant effect (4-5 half-lives) [68] Days between last dose and surgery [68]\\n Apixaban 15 -1 b CrCl >50 mL min 2 d 50 mL min 1 CrCl > 3 d CrCl >50 mL min 1 2 d CrCl > 50 mL min 1 3 d\\n -1 CrCl 30-50 mL min 3 d / 1 CrCl 30-50 mL min 4 d - 1 CrCl 30-50 mL min 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min -1 4-5 d\\n Rivaroxaban 5-13 -1 c CrCl > 50 mL min 2 d CrCl > 50 mL min -1 3 d 1 CrCl >50 mL min 2 d CrCl >50 mL min 1 3 d\\n - 1 CrCl 30-50 mL min 2 d - 1 CrCl 30-50 mL min 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min - 1 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min -1 4-5 d\\n -1 CrCl 15-29.9 mL min 3 d 1 15-29.9 mL min CrCl 4 d    \\n Dabigatran 12-17; -1 e CrCl >50 mL min 2 d -1 CrCl > 50 mL min 3 d CrCl >50 mL min -1 2 d CrCl >50 mL min -1 3 d\\n 28 d -1 CrCl 30-50 mL min 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min - 1 4-5 d CrCl 30-50 mL min -1 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min -1 4-5 d\\nCrCl = creatinine clearance.\\na Half-lives differ from those in the Summary of Product Characteristics of each agent.\\nb 1 CrCl 30-50 mL min considered as 7-8 and 17-18 hours, respectively.\\n1\\nApixaban (5 mg twice daily) half-life for CrCl >50 mL min and\\n1 1 15-29 mL min -1 considered as 8-9, 9 and 9-10.5 hours, respectively.\\nC Rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) half-life for CrCl>50 mL min , CrCl 30-50 mL min and CrCl\\nd End-stage renal disease.\\ne Dabigatran (150 mg twice daily) half-life for CrCl>50 mL min-1 and CrCl 30-50 mL min-1 considered as 14-17 and 16-18 hours, respectively.\\nG.\\nCappelleri,\\nA.\\nFanelli\\n231\\nAnticoagulation and anesthesia\\nof 4-6 hours between epidural catheter removal and the next\\ndose ofrivaroxaban [57].

Interruption of dabigatran before surgery.\\ndabigatran Summary of Product Characteristics recommends\\ndiscontinuation of the anticoagulant for ≥ 2 days before elec-\\ntive surgery that carries a high risk ofbleeding or is considered\\nto be 'major' surgery, depending on the patient's renal\\nfunction [8]. High-risk procedures, including cardiac surgery,\\nneurosurgery, abdominal surgery, or procedures requiring\\nspinal anesthesia, may require cessation ofdabigatran 2-4 days\\nbefore surgery in patients with normal renal function and > 4\\ndays before surgery in patients with moderate renal impair-\\nment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL min- 1) [70]. Based on\\nthe pharmacokinetic characteristics of dabigatran, a time inter-\\nval of36 hours (skipping 1 dose) between the last dose ofdabi-\\ngatran and puncture/catheter removal is suggested [66], but\\nthis has not been studied or confirmed.\\n4.1.3.2. Resumption of dabigatran after surgery. Pro-\\nvided hemostasis is achieved, dabigatran should be started 1-4\\nhours after the end of surgery [8]. The ESA guidelines recom-\\nmend against the use ofdabigatran in the presence ofneuraxial\\nblockade, as also advised in the dabigatran Summary of\\nProduct Characteristics [8]. If neuraxial anesthesia is used,\\nthe first dose of dabigatran should not be administered within\\n2 hours of catheter removal, in accordance with the Summary\\nof Product Characteristics [8]. The ESA guidelines recom-\\nmend a waiting time of 6 hours after catheter removal before\\nre-initiating anticoagulation with dabigatran [57]. However,\\nthe ASRA guidelines state simply that caution must be taken\\nowing to the paucity of information on the performance of\\nneuraxial block and the prolonged half-life of this anticoagu-\\nlant after multiple doses or in patients with renal impairment,\\ndespite the absence of spinal hematomas reported up to the\\npublication of these guidelines [41]. The SSAI guidelines\\nmake the sole recommendation of waiting for at least 6 hours\\nafter a central neuraxial block or catheter removal before\\nthe first dose of dabigatran is taken [64]. However, based on\\nthe pharmacokinetic characteristics of dabigatran, it may be\\nprudent to wait at least 12 hours after catheter removal before\\nadministration of dabigatran [66].\\n4.2. Laboratory measurement of direct\\noral anticoagulants\\nIn the context ofperioperative management ofpatients who\\nare receiving a direct OAC, the concentration of the direct\\nOAC can be determined if, for example, an emergency\\nsurgical intervention is required by an anticoagulated patient.\\nHowever, it is important to take into account the timing of\\nthe last dose in relation to blood sampling time when interpreting\\nthe test results [71].\\n4.2.1. Laboratory measurement of apixaban\\nThe quantitative measurement of plasma concentrations of\\napixaban can be performed using anti-Factor Xa chromogenic\\nassays and adequate standard calibration curves [72].\\nAlthough apixaban prolongs prothrombin time (PT), it is not\\nsuitable for measuring the anticoagulant effect of apixaban\\nand there is no known relationship with bleeding risk [71].\\n4.2.2. Laboratory measurement of rivaroxaban\\nThe PT can be used to determine the relative anticoagulant\\nactivity of rivaroxaban [71,73]. However, PT is not specific\\nand can be influenced by factors such as cancer, hepatic\\nimpairment, and vitamin K deficiency [74,75]. Furthermore,\\nthere is marked variability in the sensitivity of the reagents\\navailable for obtaining PT results for rivaroxaban; only a\\nsensitive reagent, such as Neoplastin Plus (Diagnostica Stago,\\nAsnieres-sur-Seine, France), should be used [76]. Importantly,\\nthe international normalized ratio must not be used for rivarox-\\naban. The quantitative measurement of plasma concentrations\\nof rivaroxaban can be performed using anti-Factor Xa\\nchromogenic assays (eg, STA Rotachrom, Diagnostica Stago,\\nAsnieres-sur-Seine, France) with validated calibrators [77].\\nWhen anti-Factor Xa assays are unavailable, a PT test with a\\nreagent sensitive to rivaroxaban may be used to confirm the\\nabsence or presence of an anticoagulant effect (if the sampling\\ntime after last tablet intake is known) [76,78,79].\\n4.2.3. Laboratory measurement of dabigatran\\nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay, for\\nexample, provides a qualitative measure of the anticoagulant\\neffect of dabigatran [73]. Unfortunately, aPTT is influenced\\nby the coagulometers and reagents used [75]. In the case of\\naPTT results for dabigatran, there is reasonable agreement\\nregardless of the reagent composition, and results are within\\n10% of reference measurements [70]. The aPTT assay may be\\nuseful in dabigatran-treated patients who require emergency\\ninterventions to exclude any clinically relevant dabigatran\\nanticoagulant effect [71,80]. The ecarin clotting time (ECT)\\nassay provides a direct measurement of the activity of dabiga-\\ntran, but is not readily available [71]. Calibrated ecarin chro-\\nmogenic assays are also available (eg, Ecarin Chromogenic\\nAssay, Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres-sur-Seine, France) and\\nmay allow faster ECT measurements than the ECT assay\\n[71]. Direct thrombin inhibitor assays (such as the\\nHEMOCLOT assay, HYPHEN BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise,\\nFrance) can be used for the quantitative measurement of\\nplasma concentrations of dabigatran [81]. In the absence of\\nthis assay, an aPTT test can be used [82].\\n5. Neurological complications and\\nregional anesthesia\\nDevelopment ofneurological complications is a major con-\\ncern in cases ofregional anesthesia in patients receiving direct\\n232\\nG. Cappelleri, A. Fanelli\\nOACs (eg, for stroke prevention). Assessment of neurological\\nfunction is the most reliable method for detecting neurological\\ninjury, because standard laboratory tests may not provide ade-\\nquate information about the coagulation status of a patient\\n[83,84]. Monitoring of neurological function during regional\\nanesthesia alongside anticoagulant therapy is essential-but\\nmay not be sufficient-to improve neurological outcomes.\\nBased on the pharmacokinetic properties of the direct OACs\\nand their rapid onset of action (within a few hours), confining\\nthe assessment of neurological function to the period between\\ncatheter removal or neuraxial puncture and 4 hours after\\nthe initiation of therapy may seem reasonable. However, a\\nlonger period of time during which neurological function\\nshould be assessed may be required, because the development\\nof neurological injury may be slow, with the onset of\\nneurological symptoms potentially taking as long as 3 or more\\ndays [55].\\n6. Use of non-neuraxial regional techniques and\\ndirect oral anticoagulants in clinical practice\\nTotal knee and hip replacement surgery causes intense\\npostoperative pain, which may impair rehabilitation and mobi-\\nlization, prolong hospitalization, and increase the risk of VTE\\n[85]. The use of continuous peripheral nerve blocks (femoral\\nand lumbar plexus blocks) for hip and knee surgery may offer\\nadvantages as a first strategy to balance the risk of hematoma\\nin anticoagulated patients compared with epidural analgesia.\\nThe results from a systematic review ofrandomized controlled\\ntrials support the use of peripheral nerve blocks as a first\\nchoice of analgesia after major orthopedic surgery; femoral\\nnerve block provided a similar analgesic profile to epidural\\nanalgesia, with fewer side-effects after total knee replacement sur-\\ngery [86]. Lumbar plexus block represents the first analgesic\\nchoice after total hip replacement surgery [87]. However, both\\nlumbar plexus and femoral nerve blocks are still associated\\nwith loss of quadricep muscle strength [88,89]. A study has\\nsuggested that an adductor canal block after knee surgery\\nmay provide a similar analgesic profile but without quadricep\\nweakness after total knee replacement surgery [88]. Although\\nno difference was observed between the 2 anesthesia tech-\\nniques in terms of morphine use or level of pain, quadricep\\nstrength was significantly better preserved with an adductor\\ncanal block than with a femoral nerve block (52% median of\\nbaseline VS 18%, P = 004) [88]. Peripheral nerve blocks have\\nbeen associated with a potential for wound hematoma with\\nadministration of heparin in some studies [57,90-93] but not\\nothers [94]. The potential severity of a hematoma in a non-\\ncompressible site and the lack of evidence on which to base\\nrecommendations for the particular use of continuous periph-\\neral nerve blocks have led the ESA and ASRA guidelines to\\nsuggest expanding the clinical recommendations for neuraxial\\nanesthesia to deeper peripheral nerve blocks, such as lumbar\\nplexus [41,57].\\nStudies specifically investigating the use of apixaban after\\nnon-neuraxial blocks in orthopedic surgery seem to be lacking.\\nHowever, there are some available data for rivaroxaban\\nand dabigatran. In a prospective observational study of 504\\npatients undergoing total knee replacement surgery who had\\ncontinuous femoral nerve block and whose femoral catheter\\nwas removed 20 hours after starting rivaroxaban (10 mg once\\ndaily), no incidences of hematoma causing neurovascular\\ncompromise at the femoral catheter site or groin area were\\nreported [95]. Neither was rivaroxaban associated with an\\nincrease in major bleeding in an observational analysis of\\n766 patients undergoing total knee or hip replacement surgery\\nand femoral, sciatic, and lumbar plexus blocks, although 3\\nhematomas in the operated knee requiring surgical evacuation\\nwere noted during rivaroxaban administration [96].\\nIn a post hoc pooled analysis of3 phase III clinical trials of\\ndabigatran (220 mg or 150 mg once daily) versus enoxaparin\\nfor VTE prevention after knee or hip replacement surgery, in\\nwhich 19% (n = 1539) received a combination of general anes-\\nthesia or neuraxial anesthesia plus peripheral nerve block, rates\\nof major VTE and VTE-related mortality were slightly higher\\nwith general anesthesia compared with neuraxial or combina-\\ntion anesthesia, although not significantly so, and neither were\\nthere significant differences in efficacy or safety outcomes\\nbetween dabigatran and enoxaparin [63].\\n7. Conclusions\\nPatients undergoing elective major orthopedic surgery\\nreceive thromboprophylaxis because of their increased risk\\nof developing VTE. With the overall aging of the population,\\nmore patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery are likely\\nto be receiving anticoagulation therapy for thromboembolic\\ndisorders prior to their surgical procedure. Several direct\\nOACs are currently approved for different therapeutic indica-\\ntions, including prevention of VTE after elective knee or hip\\nreplacement surgery, and their use in clinical practice has been\\ngrowing. Effective management of these direct OACs and\\nregional anesthesia is essential to avoid bleeding complica-\\ntions and is, therefore, a topic of crucial interest for anesthesi-\\nologists. Thromboprophylaxis with all direct OACs may start\\nbetween 1 and 24 hours after surgery [6,8,10], provided that\\nhemostasis has been achieved, and thus should present a lower\\ntheoretical risk of bleeding or neuraxial hematoma in case of\\ncentral blocks, in comparison with preoperatively initiated\\nLMWH. After surgery, restarting direct OACs can be delayed\\nby up to 48 hours in cases of bleeding or a difficult neuraxial\\nblock, and protection against thromboembolic events is\\nachieved within hours after the first dose of these agents and\\nwithout the need for bridging therapy. The effect of the type\\nof anesthesia on clinical outcomes of the direct OACs is still\\nunclear. Subanalyses of RE-MODEL, RE-NOVATE, and\\nRE-MOBILIZE data suggest that, irrespective of the anesthe-\\nsia used, neuraxial anesthesia was associated with a lower risk\\nAnticoagulation and anesthesia\\n233\\nof thromboembolic events and VTE-related mortality than\\ngeneral anesthesia [63]. Conversely, a subanalysis of pooled\\nRECORD data found no significant difference in the risk of\\nvenous thromboembolic events between these types of\\nanesthesia used [62]. A growing body of clinical study and\\nreal-world data, particularly with rivaroxaban, suggests that\\nneuraxial anesthesia can be undertaken in patients undergoing\\nmajor orthopedic surgery without increasing the risk of\\ncompressive hematoma, provided that guideline recommenda-\\ntions are followed and bleeding risk is evaluated on an individ-\\nual basis.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Li Wan for\\neditorial support, with funding from Bayer HealthCare\\nPharmaceuticals and Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.\\nReferences\\n[1] Deitelzweig SB, Johnson BH, Lin J, Schulman KL.

Introduction</h1>\\n<p id=\\'24\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>Cardiac surgery carries a high risk of peri-operative bleeding [1], as<br>evidenced by the high proportion (50-60%) of cardiac surgical patients<br>who require allogeneic blood transfusion during and after surgery [2,3].<br>The risk of bleeding in cardiac surgery is affected by numerous factors:<br>invasiveness of the procedure; use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet<br>medication; use of hypothermia; and use of cardiopulmonary bypass<br>(CPB) [1]. Several factors have been associated with an increased risk of<br>bleeding such as advanced age, poor platelet function, preoperative<br>anaemia, small body size, female sex, non-elective surgery, and repeat<br>surgery [1].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'25\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>Peri-operative bleeding has been shown to be an independent pre-<br>dictor of hospital mortality. In a study including more than 9000 pa-<br>tients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, massive blood loss (defined<br>by the transfusion of at least five units of packed red blood cells on the<br>day of surgery) was associated with an 8-fold increase in mortality [4].<br>Other studies have also reported excess morbidity, particularly in terms<br>of thromboembolic complications, infections and higher rates of surgical<br>re-exploration [5]. Notably, surgical re-exploration and transfusion<br>following bleeding are also associated with increased infection, mor-<br>tality, and a longer stay in ICU and hospital [2,6]. Finally, excessive<br>postoperative haemorrhage in cardiac surgery has a significant eco-<br>nomic impact: a retrospective German analysis of more than 1100 pa-<br>tients estimated its average additional cost to be 66251 per patient [7].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'26\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>The concept of patient blood management (PBM), defined by the<br>World Health Organization as a \"patient-focused, evidence based and<br>systematic approach for optimising the management of patients and<br>transfusion of blood products to ensure high quality and effective patient<br>care\" [8] includes an anaesthetic, pharmacological and surgical<br>approach. It is based on three pillars: optimization of blood mass,<br>minimization of blood loss and optimization of patient tolerance to<br>anaemia. In cardiac surgery, the use of antifibrinolytics is an essential<br>component of the pharmacological approach in PBM and follows rec-<br>ommendations from the European Association for Cardiothoracic Sur-<br>gery (EACTS) and the European Association of Cardiothoracic<br>Anaesthesiology (EACTA) [1].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'27\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>This review provides an overview of the major role of fibrinolysis in<br>haemostatic disorders after cardiac surgery and how it influences their<br>management, compares the current available guidelines in PBM and<br>analyses the place of different antifibrinolytics in cardiac surgery in<br>Europe, according to these guidelines.</p>\\n<p id=\\'28\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>2.

Thus, by the end of CPB, a significant proportion of<br>coagulation factors will have been consumed; fibrinogen levels are<br>decreased by approximately 40% [9] and platelets are activated,<br>consumed and show a selective loss of alpha granules. In contrast,<br>thrombin levels are elevated, which is not the case in other types of<br>surgery [10]. Along with activating the generation of fibrin, thrombin is<br>also an activator of fibrinolysis.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'31\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>Generally, fibrinolysis is a protective physiological response, pro-<br>portionately inhibiting excess clot formation. However, after massive<br>trauma, surgery, or with the use of CPB, local regulation of this response<br>may be overwhelmed, so that the systemic and simultaneous production<br>of thrombin and plasmin induces consumption coagulopathy, which<br>prevents the formation of a stable clot, resulting in bleeding [11,12].<br>Fibrinolysis is also associated with impaired platelet function during and<br>after CPB due to the action of plasmin and tissue plasminogen activator<br>(tPA) [11]. tPA is responsible for inhibition of platelet aggregation, and<br>high plasmin levels can cause damage to platelets through cleavage of</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'32\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>the GPIb receptor and triggering their partial activation, thus inducing a<br>loss of responsiveness to further activation [13,14] (Fig. 1). Thus,<br>fibrinolysis plays a major role in the pathophysiology of haemorrhage<br>during cardiac surgery, as evidenced by the strong correlation of fibri-<br>nolytic markers and the magnitude of blood loss after CPB [9,15].</p>\\n<p id=\\'33\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>2.2. Antifibrinolytic treatment</p>\\n<p id=\\'34\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:22px\\'>Antifibrinolytic drugs inhibit fibrinolysis and, when administered<br>prophylactically, help prevent peri-operative bleeding [16,17].<br>Commonly used antifibrinolytics include protease inhibitors (aprotinin)<br>and lysine analogues (tranexamic acid (TXA) and �-aminocaproic acid<br>(EACA)).</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'35\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>Aprotinin is a potent inhibitor of free plasmin which has a limited<br>effect on physiological fibrinolysis [9,18]. Aprotinin is a broad-spectrum<br>protease inhibitor, which also interacts with various other plasma pro-<br>teases such as trypsin, kallikrein and elastase. Among the anti-<br>fibrinolytics, it has the most potent activity [1,12]. It also has an anti-<br>inflammatory effect decreasing systemic inflammation after CPB [19].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'36\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>Lysine analogues are currently the most widely used anti-<br>fibrinolytics. These synthetic derivatives of lysine inhibit fibrinolysis by<br>preventing the formation of plasmin through their capacity to bind to<br>plasminogen at the lysine binding site, thus preventing its binding to<br>fibrin [11,18] (Fig. 2).</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'37\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>The prophylactic administration of antifibrinolytics in surgery has<br>been widely researched and discussed. Antifibrinolytics reduce peri and<br>post-operative bleeding, transfusions, re-operations as well as<br>morbidity, mortality, and associated costs, without increasing the inci-<br>dence of acute graft thrombosis or thromboembolism [20]. Data suggest<br>that aprotinin has an advantage over lysine analogues in reducing peri-<br>and post-operative blood loss [21]. When trial results for the two lysine<br>analogues were combined and compared with aprotinin alone, aprotinin<br>was found to be slightly more effective in reducing the need for red<br>blood cell transfusion. The data from 150 trials performed in cardiac<br>surgery in more than 17,000 patients are consistent with these results<br>[21] (Table 1).</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'38\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>In 2008, aprotinin was withdrawn from the market following the<br>publication of observational studies that reported an increased risk of<br>adverse cardiological, neurological and renal events [9,22], as well as<br>the preliminary results from a comparative, randomized, double-blind<br>study (the BART trial), which raised suspicion of excess mortality<br>linked to aprotinin [23]. However, thereafter, numerous methodological<br>flaws were found in these analyses that could have influenced their re-<br>sults. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of data from 88 trials including over<br>15,000 patients found no increased risk of mortality associated with<br>aprotinin compared with other antifibrinolytics [24]. In 2012, after re-<br>evaluation of the data, the European Medicines Agency (EMA)<br>concluded that: \"the data from the BART study concerning excess<br>mortality associated with aprotinin were not reliable\" and lifted the<br>suspension of aprotinin\\'s marketing authorization, but restricted its<br>indication to the prophylactic use in adult patients at high risk of major<br>bleeding undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) sur-<br>gery [25].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'39\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>For the lysine analogues, attention has recently been drawn to the<br>possible but rare occurrence of epileptic seizures [9]. A large retro-<br>spective study of over 11,000 patients undergoing CPB reported an<br>incidence of seizures of 0.9% in those treated with TXA. Patients with<br>epileptic seizures had a 2.5 to 3-fold higher death rate, and hospital stay<br>was twice as long. The administration of TXA has been shown to be an<br>independent predictor of seizures, correlated with higher doses [26,27].</p>\\n<p id=\\'40\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>3.

The following year, the European<br>Commission published a guide for building national PBM programs for<br>health authorities and for hospitals inside the EU [29,30]. This guide<br>defines the basics of PBM, presents some successful non-European PBM<br>initiatives and identifies current gaps and limiting factors in the<br>implementation of PBM at a large scale (lack of PBM awareness, lack of<br>undergraduate education on PBM and transfusion in nursing and med-<br>ical schools, lack of coordinated patient care, etc.).

During the preoperative phase, the authors<br>suggest a potential interest for point-of-care (POC) testing, which is<br>meant to predict perioperative bleeding. Thus, a preoperative assess-<br>ment of some specific haemostasis parameters has been proposed<br>(standard laboratory testing, viscoelastic testing and/or platelet func-<br>tion evaluation). The recommendations are as follow: 1/ preoperative<br>levels of fibrinogen may be considered to identify patients at high-risk of<br>bleeding (Class IIb - level C), and 2/ platelet function testing may be<br>considered only in patients who recently received P2Y12 inhibitors or<br>who have ongoing dual antiplatelet therapy, to guide the decision on the<br>timing of cardiac surgery (Class IIb - Level B).

The United Kingdom</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'101\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>The UK has several guidelines, each dealing with a particular aspect<br>of PBM. A short document entitled \"Patient blood management an<br>evidence-based approach to patient care, published in 2014 by the<br>National Blood Transfusion Committee (NBTC) and the NHS (National<br>Health Service) [38] provides recommendations for the implementation<br>of PBM, but not specific to cardiac surgery. TXA is cited as a pharma-<br>cological drug to be used to reduce blood loss in intraoperative man-<br>agement, and in case of major bleeding. Nevertheless, no specific<br>protocol on the use of TXA is proposed or discussed. The British Com-<br>mittee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) published two different<br>guidelines in 2015, under the GRADE rating system. The first covers the<br>identification and management of preoperative anaemia [39], and the<br>second covers haematological management of major bleeding [40] and<br>provides an overview of the organisational principles, transfusion of<br>different blood products, pharmacological agents and addresses<br>different specific situations. TXA and aprotinin are discussed, but only<br>the use ofTXA is recommended in case of major bleeding after injury, 1 g<br>intravenously over 10 min, followed by a maintenance administration of<br>1 g over 8 h (LoE1A). In non-traumatic major haemorrhage, the use of<br>TXA should be considered but not aprotinin (LoE1B). Regarding the<br>prevention of bleeding in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery,<br>the authors recommended initial administration of TXA (10 mg.kg-1)<br>followed by 1 mg.kg 1 h -1 bleeding (LoE1B). Finally,<br>to prevent<br>guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and<br>Ireland (AAGBI) were published in 2016, which address the use of blood<br>products and their alternatives [41]. They are not focused on cardiac<br>surgery but devote a chapter specifically to it. PBM measures are rec-<br>ommended in patients who are at high risk of bleeding, and TXA and<br>aprotinin are mentioned. TXA is recommended to be used as a 1 g bolus,<br>with an additional infusion of 500 mg.h 1 that could be considered.<br>Aprotinin is recommended in case of myocardial revascularisation, as<br>licensed.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\'102\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>4. Discussion</h1>\\n<p id=\\'103\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>In March 2011, the WHO held a \"Global Forum on Blood Safety:<br>Patient Blood Management\" aimed at establishing a framework for the<br>WHO Member States to actively support PBM dissemination and<br>implementation [8]. Since then, PBM programs have been implemented<br>in many countries around the world. In 2021, the WHO published a new<br>document to highlight the urgent need to close the gap in PBM aware-<br>ness and implementation and announced their upcoming initiative to<br>develop PBM implementation guidelines [42].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'104\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:22px\\'>At the European level, guidelines on bleeding management were<br>published in 2017 by the ESAIC [31] and PBM guidelines specifically</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'105\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>focussed on cardiac surgery were published in 2018 jointly by the<br>EACTS and the EACTA [1].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'106\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>Furthermore, the implementation of PBM programs has been<br>actively supported by the European Commission, in particular through<br>guides intended for national health authorities and hospitals, meant to<br>help EU member states make PBM a standard for improving the quality<br>and safety of patient care. [29,30]</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'107\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>However, while PBM practices are increasingly being used, national<br>guidelines are still rare and very few are specific to cardiac surgery. All<br>the current available guidelines follow and agree on the definition of<br>PBM as defined by the WHO [8], supported by three pillars: optimizing<br>blood volume, minimising blood loss and optimizing the patient\\'s<br>tolerance to anaemia.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'108\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>To decrease blood loss during cardiac surgery, European guidelines<br>mention that the assessment of specific haemostasis parameters in the<br>preoperative setting (such as fibrinogen level and platelet function for<br>specific patients...) could be useful to predict perioperative bleeding and<br>to decrease transfusion rates [1,43].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'109\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>Anaemia is known to be a predictor of postoperative adverse out-<br>comes for patients, so its management is the cornerstone of PBM.<br>Limiting blood loss during surgical procedures is also of paramount<br>importance to reduce the use of blood products transfusions and limit<br>the risk for reoperation for bleeding. In this context, the European and<br>national PBM guidelines all recommend the prophylactic use of anti-<br>fibrinolytics to avoid or reduce perioperative bleeding. However, they<br>differ in the type of antifibrinolytic recommended, when it should be<br>given and how (bolus or infusion or both), including the dose (Table 3).<br>Most guidelines recommend only the use of tranexamic acid. Aprotinin<br>is rarely mentioned, partly because of its recent reintroduction in<br>Europe, and its continued non-availability on the market in some<br>countries such as Italy. How Aprotinin should be given and when, as well<br>as the dose and timing of administration are mostly not discussed<br>(Table 4). National PBM guidelines for European countries therefore<br>appear to be both few in number and heterogeneous. This situation<br>could partly explain the marked discrepancies found in a recent survey<br>of PBM practices in cardiac surgery across different European countries<br>[44]. In this survey, it appears that PBM programs are not universally or<br>consistently implemented in European cardiac surgical centres, resulting<br>in differences in patient\\'s management for the same clinical situation.<br>The survey highlights that, the differences observed in guidelines,<br>including antifibrinolytic use, exist between countries at an interna-<br>tional level and also at a national level with different protocols in in-<br>dividual cardiac surgical centres within a specific country, and<br>sometimes, different protocols within the same cardiac surgical centre.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'110\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>The situation is quite different in the United States and in Australia,<br>where PBM practices are more widely implemented. The American So-<br>ciety of Anesthesiologists (ASA) published its \"Practice guidelines for<br>perioperative blood management\" in 2015 giving general recommen-<br>dations for PBM [45]. However, although the use of antifibrinolytic<br>therapy is mentioned to reduce blood loss and risk of transfusion for<br>patient at high-risk of bleeding, or undergoing CPB, no detailed protocol<br>is provided. Furthermore, institutions such as the Society for the<br>Advancement of Blood Management (SABM) and the American Associ-<br>ation of Blood Banks (AABB)) actively promote the implementation of<br>PBM in the US by providing educational resources, partnerships and<br>certification to hospitals.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'111\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>Australia appears to be one of the countries with the most compre-<br>hensive \"supply\" ofPBM literature. The National Blood Authority (NBA)<br>administers a website dedicated to PBM, including extensive PBM<br>guidelines (Critical bleeding/massive transfusion; Perioperative; Medi-<br>cal; Critical care; Obstetrics and maternity; and Neonatal and paediat-<br>rics). These PBM guidelines were published in 2012, and in 2019 a<br>survey assessed how blood transfusions and patient outcomes in cardiac<br>surgery changed after the guidelines were published [46]. The authors<br>demonstrated that, thanks to the implementation of PBM guidelines,<br>there was a significant reduction in intraoperative blood transfusions in</p>\\n<footer id=\\'112\\' style=\\'font-size:16px\\'>7</footer>\\n<header id=\\'113\\' style=\\'font-size:14px\\'>A.

The NBA also provides a national PBM imple-<br>mentation strategy guide covering 2017-2021 (updated every 4 years),<br>as well as patient information documents. It defines the principle of PBM<br>and the objectives of the national strategy, including implementation of<br>nationally coordinated measures for PBM, decreasing discrepancies in<br>clinical practices, consolidating existing PBM programs, identifying gaps<br>in knowledge and patient care, and increasing awareness and under-<br>standing of PBM.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'116\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>All in all, European countries could benefit from the experience<br>gained through these programs developed by other countries to<br>improve, accelerate and deploy the implementation of PBM at a large<br>scale.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\'117\\' style=\\'font-size:16px\\'>5. Conclusion</h1>\\n<p id=\\'118\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>Despite the trend towards high-level PBM practices, currently very<br>few European countries have national PBM guidelines and these<br>guidelines, taken as a whole, are heterogeneous in form and content.<br>Antifibrinolytics play a major role in cardiac surgery, where the risk of<br>perioperative bleeding is high and affects a majority of patients, by<br>effectively reducing bleeding, transfusions and re-operations, as well as<br>their associated morbidity and mortality. They represent an essential<br>part of the pharmacological arsenal of patient blood management.<br>However, the use of these drugs in cardiac surgery in Europe is not<br>covered in sufficient detail by national recommendations. This lack of<br>common recommendations is partly due to the scarcity of available<br>robust data. It would be of particular interest to set up comparative<br>clinical studies with the major antifibrinolytics to determine the best<br>protocols and dosages to use in practice and thus to homogenize prac-<br>tice. To complement these trials, a network meta-analysis or a system-<br>atic review of the evidence to date on antifibrinolytics in cardiac surgery<br>and their effects on major patients\\' outcomes might be useful to generate<br>important data to rely on for daily practices.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'119\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>To conclude, implementation of PBM programs in Europe is chal-<br>lenging, as there is a real need for homogenous guidance in PBM and the<br>use of antifibrinolytics, especially in cardiac surgery.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\'120\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>Financial support and sponsorship</h1>\\n<p id=\\'121\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>This work was supported by Nordic Pharma, for the institutional<br>support, and Public Health Expertise for the medical writing support.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\'122\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>Declaration of Competing Interest</h1>\\n<p id=\\'123\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:16px\\'>AK has received funding for research to his institution or honoraria<br>from Massimo, Fisher & Paykel, Pharmacosmos and Nordic Pharma.

Introduction\\nCardiac surgery carries a high risk of peri-operative bleeding [1], as\\nevidenced by the high proportion (50-60%) of cardiac surgical patients\\nwho require allogeneic blood transfusion during and after surgery [2,3].\\nThe risk of bleeding in cardiac surgery is affected by numerous factors:\\ninvasiveness of the procedure; use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet\\nmedication; use of hypothermia; and use of cardiopulmonary bypass\\n(CPB) [1]. Several factors have been associated with an increased risk of\\nbleeding such as advanced age, poor platelet function, preoperative\\nanaemia, small body size, female sex, non-elective surgery, and repeat\\nsurgery [1].\\nPeri-operative bleeding has been shown to be an independent pre-\\ndictor of hospital mortality. In a study including more than 9000 pa-\\ntients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, massive blood loss (defined\\nby the transfusion of at least five units of packed red blood cells on the\\nday of surgery) was associated with an 8-fold increase in mortality [4].\\nOther studies have also reported excess morbidity, particularly in terms\\nof thromboembolic complications, infections and higher rates of surgical\\nre-exploration [5]. Notably, surgical re-exploration and transfusion\\nfollowing bleeding are also associated with increased infection, mor-\\ntality, and a longer stay in ICU and hospital [2,6]. Finally, excessive\\npostoperative haemorrhage in cardiac surgery has a significant eco-\\nnomic impact: a retrospective German analysis of more than 1100 pa-\\ntients estimated its average additional cost to be 66251 per patient [7].\\nThe concept of patient blood management (PBM), defined by the\\nWorld Health Organization as a \"patient-focused, evidence based and\\nsystematic approach for optimising the management of patients and\\ntransfusion of blood products to ensure high quality and effective patient\\ncare\" [8] includes an anaesthetic, pharmacological and surgical\\napproach. It is based on three pillars: optimization of blood mass,\\nminimization of blood loss and optimization of patient tolerance to\\nanaemia. In cardiac surgery, the use of antifibrinolytics is an essential\\ncomponent of the pharmacological approach in PBM and follows rec-\\nommendations from the European Association for Cardiothoracic Sur-\\ngery (EACTS) and the European Association of Cardiothoracic\\nAnaesthesiology (EACTA) [1].\\nThis review provides an overview of the major role of fibrinolysis in\\nhaemostatic disorders after cardiac surgery and how it influences their\\nmanagement, compares the current available guidelines in PBM and\\nanalyses the place of different antifibrinolytics in cardiac surgery in\\nEurope, according to these guidelines.\\n2. Fibrinolysis and heart surgery - antifibrinolytic treatments\\n2.1. Haemostatic disorders induced by cardiac surgery\\nCPB used during cardiac surgery leads to activation of the coagula-\\ntion system due to blood coming into contact with foreign surfaces such\\nas plastic [9,10]. Thus, by the end of CPB, a significant proportion of\\ncoagulation factors will have been consumed; fibrinogen levels are\\ndecreased by approximately 40% [9] and platelets are activated,\\nconsumed and show a selective loss of alpha granules. In contrast,\\nthrombin levels are elevated, which is not the case in other types of\\nsurgery [10]. Along with activating the generation of fibrin, thrombin is\\nalso an activator of fibrinolysis.\\nGenerally, fibrinolysis is a protective physiological response, pro-\\nportionately inhibiting excess clot formation. However, after massive\\ntrauma, surgery, or with the use of CPB, local regulation of this response\\nmay be overwhelmed, so that the systemic and simultaneous production\\nof thrombin and plasmin induces consumption coagulopathy, which\\nprevents the formation of a stable clot, resulting in bleeding [11,12].\\nFibrinolysis is also associated with impaired platelet function during and\\nafter CPB due to the action of plasmin and tissue plasminogen activator\\n(tPA) [11]. tPA is responsible for inhibition of platelet aggregation, and\\nhigh plasmin levels can cause damage to platelets through cleavage of\\nthe GPIb receptor and triggering their partial activation, thus inducing a\\nloss of responsiveness to further activation [13,14] (Fig. 1). Thus,\\nfibrinolysis plays a major role in the pathophysiology of haemorrhage\\nduring cardiac surgery, as evidenced by the strong correlation of fibri-\\nnolytic markers and the magnitude of blood loss after CPB [9,15].\\n2.2. Antifibrinolytic treatment\\nAntifibrinolytic drugs inhibit fibrinolysis and, when administered\\nprophylactically, help prevent peri-operative bleeding [16,17].\\nCommonly used antifibrinolytics include protease inhibitors (aprotinin)\\nand lysine analogues (tranexamic acid (TXA) and �-aminocaproic acid\\n(EACA)).\\nAprotinin is a potent inhibitor of free plasmin which has a limited\\neffect on physiological fibrinolysis [9,18]. Aprotinin is a broad-spectrum\\nprotease inhibitor, which also interacts with various other plasma pro-\\nteases such as trypsin, kallikrein and elastase. Among the anti-\\nfibrinolytics, it has the most potent activity [1,12]. It also has an anti-\\ninflammatory effect decreasing systemic inflammation after CPB [19].\\nLysine analogues are currently the most widely used anti-\\nfibrinolytics. These synthetic derivatives of lysine inhibit fibrinolysis by\\npreventing the formation of plasmin through their capacity to bind to\\nplasminogen at the lysine binding site, thus preventing its binding to\\nfibrin [11,18] (Fig. 2).\\nThe prophylactic administration of antifibrinolytics in surgery has\\nbeen widely researched and discussed. Antifibrinolytics reduce peri and\\npost-operative bleeding, transfusions, re-operations as well as\\nmorbidity, mortality, and associated costs, without increasing the inci-\\ndence of acute graft thrombosis or thromboembolism [20]. Data suggest\\nthat aprotinin has an advantage over lysine analogues in reducing peri-\\nand post-operative blood loss [21]. When trial results for the two lysine\\nanalogues were combined and compared with aprotinin alone, aprotinin\\nwas found to be slightly more effective in reducing the need for red\\nblood cell transfusion. The data from 150 trials performed in cardiac\\nsurgery in more than 17,000 patients are consistent with these results\\n[21] (Table 1).\\nIn 2008, aprotinin was withdrawn from the market following the\\npublication of observational studies that reported an increased risk of\\nadverse cardiological, neurological and renal events [9,22], as well as\\nthe preliminary results from a comparative, randomized, double-blind\\nstudy (the BART trial), which raised suspicion of excess mortality\\nlinked to aprotinin [23]. However, thereafter, numerous methodological\\nflaws were found in these analyses that could have influenced their re-\\nsults. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of data from 88 trials including over\\n15,000 patients found no increased risk of mortality associated with\\naprotinin compared with other antifibrinolytics [24]. In 2012, after re-\\nevaluation of the data, the European Medicines Agency (EMA)\\nconcluded that: \"the data from the BART study concerning excess\\nmortality associated with aprotinin were not reliable\" and lifted the\\nsuspension of aprotinin\\'s marketing authorization, but restricted its\\nindication to the prophylactic use in adult patients at high risk of major\\nbleeding undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) sur-\\ngery [25].\\nFor the lysine analogues, attention has recently been drawn to the\\npossible but rare occurrence of epileptic seizures [9]. A large retro-\\nspective study of over 11,000 patients undergoing CPB reported an\\nincidence of seizures of 0.9% in those treated with TXA. Patients with\\nepileptic seizures had a 2.5 to 3-fold higher death rate, and hospital stay\\nwas twice as long. The administration of TXA has been shown to be an\\nindependent predictor of seizures, correlated with higher doses [26,27].\\n3.

It\\nconsists of implementing an integrated, multimodal and multidisci-\\nplinary strategy that is based on three \"pillars\": optimisation of the pa-\\ntient\\'s blood mass, minimisation of blood loss and optimisation of the\\npatient\\'s tolerance to anaemia, applied during the 3 periods of the sur-\\ngical intervention (preoperative, perioperative and postoperative).\\n3\\nA. Klein et al.\\nJournal of Clinical Anesthesia 78 (2022) 110654\\n3.1. Methodology for the overview of PBM guidelines in Europe\\nA literature search was performed in December 2020 and repeated in\\nJanuary 2021 using PubMed, Cochrane Database and Google Scholar\\ndatabases. Twelve documents were identified containing or related to\\nPBM guidelines. Of these 13 articles, 8 were actual PBM guidelines\\n(Table 2).\\n3.2. European guidelines\\nThe European Commission promotes the implementation of PBM\\nprograms, by supporting the \"Optimal Blood Use Project\" which led to\\nthe creation of a website and to publication in 2016 of the \"Manual of\\nOptimal Blood Use\" [28]. The use of antifibrinolytics is mentioned to\\navoid the need for transfusion during elective surgery, notably TXA for\\npatients with high risk of bleeding. The following year, the European\\nCommission published a guide for building national PBM programs for\\nhealth authorities and for hospitals inside the EU [29,30]. This guide\\ndefines the basics of PBM, presents some successful non-European PBM\\ninitiatives and identifies current gaps and limiting factors in the\\nimplementation of PBM at a large scale (lack of PBM awareness, lack of\\nundergraduate education on PBM and transfusion in nursing and med-\\nical schools, lack of coordinated patient care, etc.). This guide is to be\\nused as a tool setting the framework for national authorities to support\\nthe implementation and dissemination of PBM programs across Europe.\\nAt the European level, an update of the \"Management of severe\\nperioperative bleeding\" guidelines was published in 2017 by the ESAIC\\n[31]. These general PBM recommendations are not focused on cardiac\\nsurgery; nevertheless, the management of cardiac surgical patients is\\ndiscussed. The recommendations are classified according to the GRADE\\n(Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evalua-\\ntion) system. In cardiovascular surgery, the authors recommend the\\nprophylactic administration of TXA before CPB in patients undergoing\\nCABG (level of evidence (LoE) 1A). Besides, topical application of TXA\\nto the chest cavity in order to reduce blood loss following cardiac sur-\\ngery is also suggested (LoE 2C). Aprotinin is mentioned throughout the\\ndocument, with comparison of the efficacy data from several clinical\\ntrials. No detailed protocol or dosing regimens for the use of anti-\\nfibrinolytics (either TXA or aprotinin) is provided in these guidelines\\nand the indications for the use of aprotinin are not defined.\\nEuropean PBM guidelines specifically dedicated to cardiac surgery\\nwere published jointly in 2018 by the EACTS and the EACTA [1]. The\\nrecommendations are divided according to the three steps of the surgical\\nprocedure: preoperative management, intraoperative management, and\\npostoperative management. During the preoperative phase, the authors\\nsuggest a potential interest for point-of-care (POC) testing, which is\\nmeant to predict perioperative bleeding. Thus, a preoperative assess-\\nment of some specific haemostasis parameters has been proposed\\n(standard laboratory testing, viscoelastic testing and/or platelet func-\\ntion evaluation). The recommendations are as follow: 1/ preoperative\\nlevels of fibrinogen may be considered to identify patients at high-risk of\\nbleeding (Class IIb - level C), and 2/ platelet function testing may be\\nconsidered only in patients who recently received P2Y12 inhibitors or\\nwho have ongoing dual antiplatelet therapy, to guide the decision on the\\ntiming of cardiac surgery (Class IIb - Level B). In the perioperative\\nsetting, treatment algorithms based on viscoelastic POC tests should be\\nconsidered in order to reduce the number of transfusions for the\\nbleeding patient (Class IIa - Level B).\\nAntifibrinolytics (TXA, aprotinin or EACA) are recommended during\\nthe intraoperative period to reduce blood loss and the need for trans-\\nfusion, and also to reduce the risk of reoperation for bleeding (TXA and\\naprotinin) (level of evidence 1A). No therapeutic protocols or dosing\\nregimens for the use of antifibrinolytics are recommended. Finally, the\\nimplementation of a PBM protocol for bleeding patients is recommended\\n(LoE1C).\\n3.3. National guidelines\\n3.3.1. France\\nSpecific guidelines dedicated to PBM are currently not available in\\nFrance, however, a White Paper was published in 2018 [32] by several\\nlearned societies (French Society of Anaesthesia and Resuscitation;\\nStudy Group on Haemostasis and Thrombosis; French Society of\\nThoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery; French Society of Vigilance and\\nTherapeutics).\\nThis publication summarizes the principles of PBM with the three-\\npillars-based approach and presents a series of recommendations for\\nthe implementation of PBM in France. It includes an international\\nliterature review, a multidisciplinary field survey and recommendations\\nfrom the scientific committee to provide guidance on the implementa-\\ntion of PBM programs. The field survey demonstrated that PBM as a\\nformalized concept was not very well known by French practitioners.\\nRegarding the use of antifibrinolytics, the authors recommended TXA (1\\ng) at anaesthetic induction and at the end of the surgical procedure (1 g).\\nThe authors considered that the topical application of TXA needs further\\nresearch. It should serve as a basis for French guidelines on PBM, which\\nare expected soon by the Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS) [33].\\n3.3.2. Germany\\nIn 2020, cross-sectional guidelines on therapy with blood compo-\\nnents and plasma derivatives were published by the Executive board of\\nthe German Medical Association [34]. Cardiac surgery is mentioned\\nthroughout the document, but without any discussion on the potential\\nuse of antifibrinolytics. However, the use of TXA is recommended to\\nlimit blood loss in several types of surgical procedures and for the peri-\\nand postpartum period.\\n3.3.3. Italy\\nThe Italian Society of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and\\nIntensive Care has written a position paper on the clinical standards for\\nPBM, and perioperative haemostasis and coagulation management in\\n2019 [35]. These recommendations are divided according to the three\\nsteps of any surgical procedure (pre-, peri- and postoperative period),\\neach one being subdivided according to the three pillars of PBM\\napproach. Cardiac surgery is discussed throughout the document. The\\nuse of antifibrinolytics is discussed in the \"Pillar 2 - Blood containment\"\\nsection of the chapter on perioperative management. No detailed\\nguidelines are provided, but prophylactic administration of TXA is rec-\\nommended before CPB in patients undergoing CABG, as advised in the\\nESAIC guidelines [31]. Finally, the authors mentioned that to decrease\\nthe risk of postoperative blood loss following cardiac surgery, TXA can\\nbe applied topically.\\n3.3.4. The Netherlands\\nGuidelines on blood transfusion have been published in 2011 by the\\nDutch Institute For Healthcare Improvement [36]. They are not dedi-\\ncated to PBM, which is not surprising as this concept was just emerging\\nat that time. However, these guidelines include \"Blood saving tech-\\nniques and medications,\" which covers the following points: techniques\\nto limit blood loss during surgical procedures; preoperative and peri-\\noperative autologous blood transfusion techniques; and combination of\\nblood saving techniques. Cardiac surgery and the use of antifibrinolytics\\nare discussed through the document. Aprotinin and TXA are mentioned.\\nHowever, at the time of publication, aprotinin had been withdrawn from\\nthe market, thus its use is not recommended. TXA is described as a safe\\nand effective drug to reduce blood loss and transfusion in cardiac sur-\\ngery (evidence Level 1A1).\\n3.3.5. Romania\\nThe Romanian Patient Blood Management Initiative Group pub-\\nlished national recommendations about perioperative PBM programme\\nin 2017 [37].

The United Kingdom\\nThe UK has several guidelines, each dealing with a particular aspect\\nof PBM. A short document entitled \"Patient blood management an\\nevidence-based approach to patient care, published in 2014 by the\\nNational Blood Transfusion Committee (NBTC) and the NHS (National\\nHealth Service) [38] provides recommendations for the implementation\\nof PBM, but not specific to cardiac surgery. TXA is cited as a pharma-\\ncological drug to be used to reduce blood loss in intraoperative man-\\nagement, and in case of major bleeding. Nevertheless, no specific\\nprotocol on the use of TXA is proposed or discussed. The British Com-\\nmittee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) published two different\\nguidelines in 2015, under the GRADE rating system. The first covers the\\nidentification and management of preoperative anaemia [39], and the\\nsecond covers haematological management of major bleeding [40] and\\nprovides an overview of the organisational principles, transfusion of\\ndifferent blood products, pharmacological agents and addresses\\ndifferent specific situations. TXA and aprotinin are discussed, but only\\nthe use ofTXA is recommended in case of major bleeding after injury, 1 g\\nintravenously over 10 min, followed by a maintenance administration of\\n1 g over 8 h (LoE1A). In non-traumatic major haemorrhage, the use of\\nTXA should be considered but not aprotinin (LoE1B). Regarding the\\nprevention of bleeding in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery,\\nthe authors recommended initial administration of TXA (10 mg.kg-1)\\nfollowed by 1 mg.kg 1 h -1 bleeding (LoE1B). Finally,\\nto prevent\\nguidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and\\nIreland (AAGBI) were published in 2016, which address the use of blood\\nproducts and their alternatives [41]. They are not focused on cardiac\\nsurgery but devote a chapter specifically to it. PBM measures are rec-\\nommended in patients who are at high risk of bleeding, and TXA and\\naprotinin are mentioned. TXA is recommended to be used as a 1 g bolus,\\nwith an additional infusion of 500 mg.h 1 that could be considered.\\nAprotinin is recommended in case of myocardial revascularisation, as\\nlicensed.\\n4. Discussion\\nIn March 2011, the WHO held a \"Global Forum on Blood Safety:\\nPatient Blood Management\" aimed at establishing a framework for the\\nWHO Member States to actively support PBM dissemination and\\nimplementation [8]. Since then, PBM programs have been implemented\\nin many countries around the world. In 2021, the WHO published a new\\ndocument to highlight the urgent need to close the gap in PBM aware-\\nness and implementation and announced their upcoming initiative to\\ndevelop PBM implementation guidelines [42].\\nAt the European level, guidelines on bleeding management were\\npublished in 2017 by the ESAIC [31] and PBM guidelines specifically\\nfocussed on cardiac surgery were published in 2018 jointly by the\\nEACTS and the EACTA [1].\\nFurthermore, the implementation of PBM programs has been\\nactively supported by the European Commission, in particular through\\nguides intended for national health authorities and hospitals, meant to\\nhelp EU member states make PBM a standard for improving the quality\\nand safety of patient care. [29,30]\\nHowever, while PBM practices are increasingly being used, national\\nguidelines are still rare and very few are specific to cardiac surgery. All\\nthe current available guidelines follow and agree on the definition of\\nPBM as defined by the WHO [8], supported by three pillars: optimizing\\nblood volume, minimising blood loss and optimizing the patient\\'s\\ntolerance to anaemia.\\nTo decrease blood loss during cardiac surgery, European guidelines\\nmention that the assessment of specific haemostasis parameters in the\\npreoperative setting (such as fibrinogen level and platelet function for\\nspecific patients...) could be useful to predict perioperative bleeding and\\nto decrease transfusion rates [1,43].\\nAnaemia is known to be a predictor of postoperative adverse out-\\ncomes for patients, so its management is the cornerstone of PBM.\\nLimiting blood loss during surgical procedures is also of paramount\\nimportance to reduce the use of blood products transfusions and limit\\nthe risk for reoperation for bleeding. In this context, the European and\\nnational PBM guidelines all recommend the prophylactic use of anti-\\nfibrinolytics to avoid or reduce perioperative bleeding. However, they\\ndiffer in the type of antifibrinolytic recommended, when it should be\\ngiven and how (bolus or infusion or both), including the dose (Table 3).\\nMost guidelines recommend only the use of tranexamic acid. Aprotinin\\nis rarely mentioned, partly because of its recent reintroduction in\\nEurope, and its continued non-availability on the market in some\\ncountries such as Italy. How Aprotinin should be given and when, as well\\nas the dose and timing of administration are mostly not discussed\\n(Table 4). National PBM guidelines for European countries therefore\\nappear to be both few in number and heterogeneous. This situation\\ncould partly explain the marked discrepancies found in a recent survey\\nof PBM practices in cardiac surgery across different European countries\\n[44]. In this survey, it appears that PBM programs are not universally or\\nconsistently implemented in European cardiac surgical centres, resulting\\nin differences in patient\\'s management for the same clinical situation.\\nThe survey highlights that, the differences observed in guidelines,\\nincluding antifibrinolytic use, exist between countries at an interna-\\ntional level and also at a national level with different protocols in in-\\ndividual cardiac surgical centres within a specific country, and\\nsometimes, different protocols within the same cardiac surgical centre.\\nThe situation is quite different in the United States and in Australia,\\nwhere PBM practices are more widely implemented. The American So-\\nciety of Anesthesiologists (ASA) published its \"Practice guidelines for\\nperioperative blood management\" in 2015 giving general recommen-\\ndations for PBM [45]. However, although the use of antifibrinolytic\\ntherapy is mentioned to reduce blood loss and risk of transfusion for\\npatient at high-risk of bleeding, or undergoing CPB, no detailed protocol\\nis provided. Furthermore, institutions such as the Society for the\\nAdvancement of Blood Management (SABM) and the American Associ-\\nation of Blood Banks (AABB)) actively promote the implementation of\\nPBM in the US by providing educational resources, partnerships and\\ncertification to hospitals.\\nAustralia appears to be one of the countries with the most compre-\\nhensive \"supply\" ofPBM literature. The National Blood Authority (NBA)\\nadministers a website dedicated to PBM, including extensive PBM\\nguidelines (Critical bleeding/massive transfusion; Perioperative; Medi-\\ncal; Critical care; Obstetrics and maternity; and Neonatal and paediat-\\nrics). These PBM guidelines were published in 2012, and in 2019 a\\nsurvey assessed how blood transfusions and patient outcomes in cardiac\\nsurgery changed after the guidelines were published [46]. The authors\\ndemonstrated that, thanks to the implementation of PBM guidelines,\\nthere was a significant reduction in intraoperative blood transfusions in\\n7\\nA. Klein et al.\\nJournal of Clinical Anesthesia 78 (2022) 110654\\npatients undergoing cardiac surgery, and an associated reduction in\\nhospital length of stay. The NBA also provides a national PBM imple-\\nmentation strategy guide covering 2017-2021 (updated every 4 years),\\nas well as patient information documents. It defines the principle of PBM\\nand the objectives of the national strategy, including implementation of\\nnationally coordinated measures for PBM, decreasing discrepancies in\\nclinical practices, consolidating existing PBM programs, identifying gaps\\nin knowledge and patient care, and increasing awareness and under-\\nstanding of PBM.\\nAll in all, European countries could benefit from the experience\\ngained through these programs developed by other countries to\\nimprove, accelerate and deploy the implementation of PBM at a large\\nscale.\\n5. Conclusion\\nDespite the trend towards high-level PBM practices, currently very\\nfew European countries have national PBM guidelines and these\\nguidelines, taken as a whole, are heterogeneous in form and content.\\nAntifibrinolytics play a major role in cardiac surgery, where the risk of\\nperioperative bleeding is high and affects a majority of patients, by\\neffectively reducing bleeding, transfusions and re-operations, as well as\\ntheir associated morbidity and mortality. They represent an essential\\npart of the pharmacological arsenal of patient blood management.\\nHowever, the use of these drugs in cardiac surgery in Europe is not\\ncovered in sufficient detail by national recommendations. This lack of\\ncommon recommendations is partly due to the scarcity of available\\nrobust data. It would be of particular interest to set up comparative\\nclinical studies with the major antifibrinolytics to determine the best\\nprotocols and dosages to use in practice and thus to homogenize prac-\\ntice. To complement these trials, a network meta-analysis or a system-\\natic review of the evidence to date on antifibrinolytics in cardiac surgery\\nand their effects on major patients\\' outcomes might be useful to generate\\nimportant data to rely on for daily practices.\\nTo conclude, implementation of PBM programs in Europe is chal-\\nlenging, as there is a real need for homogenous guidance in PBM and the\\nuse of antifibrinolytics, especially in cardiac surgery.\\nFinancial support and sponsorship\\nThis work was supported by Nordic Pharma, for the institutional\\nsupport, and Public Health Expertise for the medical writing support.\\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\\nAK has received funding for research to his institution or honoraria\\nfrom Massimo, Fisher & Paykel, Pharmacosmos and Nordic Pharma.

Given<br>the extensive use ofregional anesthesia in surgery and the increasing number ofpatients receiving direct oral<br>anticoagulants, it is crucial to understand the current clinical data on the risk ofhemorrhagic complications in<br>this setting, particularly for anesthesiologists.

In Europe,<br>rivaroxaban is also indicated for co-administration with acetyl-<br>salicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or<br>ticlopidine for the prevention of atherothrombotic events after<br>acute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers<br>[10]. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct inhibitors of Factor<br>Xa, whereas dabigatran is a direct inhibitor of thrombin.<br>All three agents have been found to exhibit predictable<br>pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and have a fast<br>onset of action-reaching maximum plasma concentration<br>rapidly after oral administration (apixaban, 3-4 hours; rivarox-<br>aban, 2-4 hours; dabigatran, 0.5-2.0 hours) [6,8,10,12-15].<br>The half-lives of apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran are<br>~12 hours, 5-13 hours, and 11-14 hours, respectively<br>[6,8,10]. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacody-<br>namic characteristics are not influenced to a clinically mean-<br>ingful extent by body weight, age, or gender, which<br>collectively indicate that these direct OACs can be given as<br>fixed dosing regimens without the need for routine coagulation<br>monitoring [16-20]. The routes of drug elimination differ be-<br>tween the 2 drug classes: apixaban and rivaroxaban have mul-<br>tiple pathways including renal excretion (~27% and 66%<br>[33% as active drug and 33% after metabolic degradation], re-<br>spectively), whereas elimination of dabigatran is predominant-<br>ly via the renal system (85%) [6,8,10,21]. In patients receiving<br>dabigatran for the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replace-<br>ment surgery, a dose reduction is required in those with mod-<br>erate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL min-1),<br>those aged 75 years or over, and those taking concomitant<br>mild-to-moderate P-glycoprotein inhibitors [8]. Owing to their<br>mode of action, all anticoagulants can increase the risk of<br>bleeding events. However, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabiga-<br>tran did not pose any significantly increased risk of major<br>bleeding events compared with enoxaparin in phase III clinical<br>trials in the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replacement<br>surgery [22-30]. Despite the clinical evidence on the safety<br>and efficacy profile ofdirect OACs demonstrated in clinical trials,<br>physicians- particularly anesthesiologists-need to be aware of<br>how to minimize the risks of bleeding complications when treat-<br>ing patients who are taking an anticoagulant and are due to under-<br>go surgery with regional anesthesia.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'21\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:14px\\'>Regional anesthesia techniques have become increasingly pop-<br>ular because they offer several benefits over general anesthesia and<br>traditional systemic analgesia, including reduced risk of mortality<br>and less postoperative pain, thus facilitating early postoperative<br>mobilization of the limbs and consequently reducing the chances<br>of postoperative VTE [31,32]. Regional anesthesia is used in<br>millions of operations each year and, at a time when the use<br>of the direct OACs is growing, bleeding-related complications<br>could arise if appropriate guidance is not followed [33]. This<br>review aims to provide anesthesiologists with an overview of<br>current data on the risk of hemorrhagic complications with<br>direct OACs when using regional anesthesia, particularly<br>in patients at a high risk of VTE, such as those undergoing<br>major orthopedic surgery.

Serious complications, such as<br>spinal or epidural hematoma and epidural abscess, are rare and<br>therefore difficult to study in detail [37]. For peripheral nerve<br>block, neurological complications are extremely rare, ranging<br>between 0.02% and 0.04% [38,39].</p>\\n<p id=\\'25\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>2.1.

However, the incidence of spinal hematoma<br>increases with the presence ofany risk factors, listed in Table 1,<br>and more so ifheparin anticoagulation is accompanied by trau-<br>matic puncture (increasing incidence rates to 1 in 2000 and 1<br>in 2900 for epidural and spinal anesthesia, respectively). For<br>ASA therapy the risk is 1 in 8500 and 1 in 12 000 for epidural<br>and spinal anesthesia, respectively [41,42].

Of the 13 cases of neuraxial hematoma reported<br>from a total of 1.4 million procedures involving neuraxial<br>central blocks, 10 were associated with thromboprophylaxis<br>(enoxaparin, dalteparin, or fondaparinux); however, for<br>6 of 10 of these occurrences, the time elapsed between<br>cessation/initiation of thromboprophylaxis and puncture may<br>not have been sufficient to prevent a bleeding event [44]. A<br>recent retrospective study on the safety of epidural and spinal<br>neuraxial block showed that the incidence of perioperative<br>neurological complications in orthopedic patients was rela-<br>tively low (0.96/1000; 95% CI 0.77-1.16/1000), but was<br>higher than previously reported in other non-obstetric popula-<br>tions [45].

Patient-related factors increasing the risk of<br>spinal hematoma</p>\\n<p id=\\'37\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>Regarding patient-related factors, clinicians must exercise<br>particular care with elderly patients requiring surgical inter-<br>vention- these patients are at increased risk of thrombo-<br>embolic disorders [46,47] and are, therefore, more likely to<br>be receiving anticoagulants. Furthermore, the bleeding risk in<br>elderly patients receiving anticoagulants is augmented<br>[48,49]. Elderly patients are also more likely to have renal or he-<br>patic impairment, causing increased drug plasma concentrations,<br>and consequently drug elimination may be slower in these<br>patients [50]. Real-world data from the RIETE (Registro Infor-<br>matizado de Pacientes con Enfermedad TromboEmb�lica)<br>registry have shown major and fatal bleeding to be more com-<br>mon in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy who were<br>aged > 80 years compared with those aged <80 years (3.4%<br>vs 2.1% and 0.8% vs 0.4%, respectively) [51]. Therefore,<br>knowledge about the metabolism ofthe direct OACs approved<br>for VTE prevention after major orthopedic surgery is essential<br>when deciding which anticoagulant to prescribe to a particular<br>patient. Whereas the metabolism of dabigatran is mostly<br>dependent on renal clearance, the metabolism of apixaban<br>and rivaroxaban involves multiple pathways and is less<br>dependent on renal function (Table 2). The high frequency of<br>co-medication use in elderly patients also increases both the<br>potential for drug-drug interactions and the risk ofbleeding [52].</p>\\n<p id=\\'38\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:22px\\'>2.4.

The risk of spinal hematoma in patients<br>receiving low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) concomi-<br>tantly with epidural anesthesia is reported to be 1:6600 for<br>single-shot epidural and 1:3100 with an indwelling catheter<br>for the LMWH dosage of 30 mg twice daily and 1:18 000<br>for a 40 mg once-daily dosage [57,58].

Resumption of dabigatran after surgery. Pro-<br>vided hemostasis is achieved, dabigatran should be started 1-4<br>hours after the end of surgery [8]. The ESA guidelines recom-<br>mend against the use ofdabigatran in the presence ofneuraxial<br>blockade, as also advised in the dabigatran Summary of<br>Product Characteristics [8]. If neuraxial anesthesia is used,<br>the first dose of dabigatran should not be administered within<br>2 hours of catheter removal, in accordance with the Summary<br>of Product Characteristics [8]. The ESA guidelines recom-<br>mend a waiting time of 6 hours after catheter removal before<br>re-initiating anticoagulation with dabigatran [57]. However,<br>the ASRA guidelines state simply that caution must be taken<br>owing to the paucity of information on the performance of<br>neuraxial block and the prolonged half-life of this anticoagu-<br>lant after multiple doses or in patients with renal impairment,<br>despite the absence of spinal hematomas reported up to the<br>publication of these guidelines [41]. The SSAI guidelines<br>make the sole recommendation of waiting for at least 6 hours<br>after a central neuraxial block or catheter removal before<br>the first dose of dabigatran is taken [64]. However, based on<br>the pharmacokinetic characteristics of dabigatran, it may be<br>prudent to wait at least 12 hours after catheter removal before<br>administration of dabigatran [66].</p>\\n<p id=\\'92\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>4.2.

However, PT is not specific<br>and can be influenced by factors such as cancer, hepatic<br>impairment, and vitamin K deficiency [74,75]. Furthermore,<br>there is marked variability in the sensitivity of the reagents<br>available for obtaining PT results for rivaroxaban; only a<br>sensitive reagent, such as Neoplastin Plus (Diagnostica Stago,<br>Asnieres-sur-Seine, France), should be used [76]. Importantly,<br>the international normalized ratio must not be used for rivarox-<br>aban. The quantitative measurement of plasma concentrations<br>of rivaroxaban can be performed using anti-Factor Xa<br>chromogenic assays (eg, STA Rotachrom, Diagnostica Stago,<br>Asnieres-sur-Seine, France) with validated calibrators [77].<br>When anti-Factor Xa assays are unavailable, a PT test with a<br>reagent sensitive to rivaroxaban may be used to confirm the<br>absence or presence of an anticoagulant effect (if the sampling<br>time after last tablet intake is known) [76,78,79].</p>\\n<p id=\\'98\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>4.2.3.

Unfortunately, aPTT is influenced<br>by the coagulometers and reagents used [75]. In the case of<br>aPTT results for dabigatran, there is reasonable agreement<br>regardless of the reagent composition, and results are within<br>10% of reference measurements [70]. The aPTT assay may be<br>useful in dabigatran-treated patients who require emergency<br>interventions to exclude any clinically relevant dabigatran<br>anticoagulant effect [71,80]. The ecarin clotting time (ECT)<br>assay provides a direct measurement of the activity of dabiga-<br>tran, but is not readily available [71]. Calibrated ecarin chro-<br>mogenic assays are also available (eg, Ecarin Chromogenic<br>Assay, Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres-sur-Seine, France) and<br>may allow faster ECT measurements than the ECT assay<br>[71]. Direct thrombin inhibitor assays (such as the<br>HEMOCLOT assay, HYPHEN BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise,<br>France) can be used for the quantitative measurement of<br>plasma concentrations of dabigatran [81]. In the absence of<br>this assay, an aPTT test can be used [82].</p>\\n<p id=\\'100\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:22px\\'>5.

The use of continuous peripheral nerve blocks (femoral<br>and lumbar plexus blocks) for hip and knee surgery may offer<br>advantages as a first strategy to balance the risk of hematoma<br>in anticoagulated patients compared with epidural analgesia.<br>The results from a systematic review ofrandomized controlled<br>trials support the use of peripheral nerve blocks as a first<br>choice of analgesia after major orthopedic surgery; femoral<br>nerve block provided a similar analgesic profile to epidural<br>analgesia, with fewer side-effects after total knee replacement sur-<br>gery [86]. Lumbar plexus block represents the first analgesic<br>choice after total hip replacement surgery [87]. However, both<br>lumbar plexus and femoral nerve blocks are still associated<br>with loss of quadricep muscle strength [88,89]. A study has<br>suggested that an adductor canal block after knee surgery<br>may provide a similar analgesic profile but without quadricep<br>weakness after total knee replacement surgery [88]. Although<br>no difference was observed between the 2 anesthesia tech-<br>niques in terms of morphine use or level of pain, quadricep<br>strength was significantly better preserved with an adductor<br>canal block than with a femoral nerve block (52% median of<br>baseline VS 18%, P = 004) [88]. Peripheral nerve blocks have<br>been associated with a potential for wound hematoma with<br>administration of heparin in some studies [57,90-93] but not<br>others [94]. The potential severity of a hematoma in a non-<br>compressible site and the lack of evidence on which to base<br>recommendations for the particular use of continuous periph-<br>eral nerve blocks have led the ESA and ASRA guidelines to<br>suggest expanding the clinical recommendations for neuraxial<br>anesthesia to deeper peripheral nerve blocks, such as lumbar<br>plexus [41,57].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'107\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:14px\\'>Studies specifically investigating the use of apixaban after<br>non-neuraxial blocks in orthopedic surgery seem to be lacking.<br>However, there are some available data for rivaroxaban<br>and dabigatran.

Conclusions</h1>\\n<p id=\\'110\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:14px\\'>Patients undergoing elective major orthopedic surgery<br>receive thromboprophylaxis because of their increased risk<br>of developing VTE. With the overall aging of the population,<br>more patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery are likely<br>to be receiving anticoagulation therapy for thromboembolic<br>disorders prior to their surgical procedure. Several direct<br>OACs are currently approved for different therapeutic indica-<br>tions, including prevention of VTE after elective knee or hip<br>replacement surgery, and their use in clinical practice has been<br>growing. Effective management of these direct OACs and<br>regional anesthesia is essential to avoid bleeding complica-<br>tions and is, therefore, a topic of crucial interest for anesthesi-<br>ologists. Thromboprophylaxis with all direct OACs may start<br>between 1 and 24 hours after surgery [6,8,10], provided that<br>hemostasis has been achieved, and thus should present a lower<br>theoretical risk of bleeding or neuraxial hematoma in case of<br>central blocks, in comparison with preoperatively initiated<br>LMWH. After surgery, restarting direct OACs can be delayed<br>by up to 48 hours in cases of bleeding or a difficult neuraxial<br>block, and protection against thromboembolic events is<br>achieved within hours after the first dose of these agents and<br>without the need for bridging therapy. The effect of the type<br>of anesthesia on clinical outcomes of the direct OACs is still<br>unclear. Subanalyses of RE-MODEL, RE-NOVATE, and<br>RE-MOBILIZE data suggest that, irrespective of the anesthe-<br>sia used, neuraxial anesthesia was associated with a lower risk</p>\\n<header id=\\'111\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>Anticoagulation and anesthesia</header>\\n<br><header id=\\'112\\' style=\\'font-size:16px\\'>233</header>\\n<p id=\\'113\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:14px\\'>of thromboembolic events and VTE-related mortality than<br>general anesthesia [63]. Conversely, a subanalysis of pooled<br>RECORD data found no significant difference in the risk of<br>venous thromboembolic events between these types of<br>anesthesia used [62]. A growing body of clinical study and<br>real-world data, particularly with rivaroxaban, suggests that<br>neuraxial anesthesia can be undertaken in patients undergoing<br>major orthopedic surgery without increasing the risk of<br>compressive hematoma, provided that guideline recommenda-<br>tions are followed and bleeding risk is evaluated on an individ-<br>ual basis.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\'114\\' style=\\'font-size:22px\\'>Acknowledgements</h1>\\n<p id=\\'115\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:16px\\'>The authors would like to acknowledge Li Wan for<br>editorial support, with funding from Bayer HealthCare<br>Pharmaceuticals and Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.</p>\\n<p id=\\'116\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>References</p>\\n<p id=\\'117\\' data-category=\\'list\\' style=\\'font-size:14px\\'>[1] Deitelzweig SB, Johnson BH, Lin J, Schulman KL.

In Europe,\\nrivaroxaban is also indicated for co-administration with acetyl-\\nsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or\\nticlopidine for the prevention of atherothrombotic events after\\nacute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers\\n[10]. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct inhibitors of Factor\\nXa, whereas dabigatran is a direct inhibitor of thrombin.\\nAll three agents have been found to exhibit predictable\\npharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and have a fast\\nonset of action-reaching maximum plasma concentration\\nrapidly after oral administration (apixaban, 3-4 hours; rivarox-\\naban, 2-4 hours; dabigatran, 0.5-2.0 hours) [6,8,10,12-15].\\nThe half-lives of apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran are\\n~12 hours, 5-13 hours, and 11-14 hours, respectively\\n[6,8,10]. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacody-\\nnamic characteristics are not influenced to a clinically mean-\\ningful extent by body weight, age, or gender, which\\ncollectively indicate that these direct OACs can be given as\\nfixed dosing regimens without the need for routine coagulation\\nmonitoring [16-20]. The routes of drug elimination differ be-\\ntween the 2 drug classes: apixaban and rivaroxaban have mul-\\ntiple pathways including renal excretion (~27% and 66%\\n[33% as active drug and 33% after metabolic degradation], re-\\nspectively), whereas elimination of dabigatran is predominant-\\nly via the renal system (85%) [6,8,10,21]. In patients receiving\\ndabigatran for the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replace-\\nment surgery, a dose reduction is required in those with mod-\\nerate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL min-1),\\nthose aged 75 years or over, and those taking concomitant\\nmild-to-moderate P-glycoprotein inhibitors [8]. Owing to their\\nmode of action, all anticoagulants can increase the risk of\\nbleeding events. However, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabiga-\\ntran did not pose any significantly increased risk of major\\nbleeding events compared with enoxaparin in phase III clinical\\ntrials in the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replacement\\nsurgery [22-30]. Despite the clinical evidence on the safety\\nand efficacy profile ofdirect OACs demonstrated in clinical trials,\\nphysicians- particularly anesthesiologists-need to be aware of\\nhow to minimize the risks of bleeding complications when treat-\\ning patients who are taking an anticoagulant and are due to under-\\ngo surgery with regional anesthesia.\\nRegional anesthesia techniques have become increasingly pop-\\nular because they offer several benefits over general anesthesia and\\ntraditional systemic analgesia, including reduced risk of mortality\\nand less postoperative pain, thus facilitating early postoperative\\nmobilization of the limbs and consequently reducing the chances\\nof postoperative VTE [31,32]. Regional anesthesia is used in\\nmillions of operations each year and, at a time when the use\\nof the direct OACs is growing, bleeding-related complications\\ncould arise if appropriate guidance is not followed [33]. This\\nreview aims to provide anesthesiologists with an overview of\\ncurrent data on the risk of hemorrhagic complications with\\ndirect OACs when using regional anesthesia, particularly\\nin patients at a high risk of VTE, such as those undergoing\\nmajor orthopedic surgery. Moreover, current guideline\\nrecommendations will be discussed and best practice in specific\\nclinical situations, such as in patients with renal impairment who\\nare at an increased risk of bleeding, will be highlighted.\\n2. Regional anesthesia and complications\\nThe most common complications of regional anesthesia\\ninclude postdural puncture headache (occurs in 0.1%-36% of\\npatients but rarely lasts longer than 7 days) [34], backache (af-\\nfects up to 11% of patients in the 5 days after the procedure)\\n[35], and peripheral nerve damage (eg, transient paresthesia\\nis estimated in up to 8%- 10% of patients in the immediate days\\nafter regional anesthesia) [36]. Serious complications, such as\\nspinal or epidural hematoma and epidural abscess, are rare and\\ntherefore difficult to study in detail [37]. For peripheral nerve\\nblock, neurological complications are extremely rare, ranging\\nbetween 0.02% and 0.04% [38,39].\\n2.1. Risk factors associated with regional anesthesia\\nIn a systematic review of 141 studies (n = 9559),\\nneuraxial anesthesia was shown to be associated with lower\\nrates of mortality (2.1% vs 3.1%; odds ratio [OR] 0.7; 95%\\nconfidence interval [CI] 0.54-0.90; P = .006), occurrence of\\nDVT (odds reduction of 44%; OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.43-0. 72;\\nP < .001) and PE (odds reduction of 55%; OR 0.45; 95% CI\\n0.29-0.69; P < .001), among other outcomes [31]. A more re-\\ncent observational study showed that neuraxial anesthesia was\\nassociated with a significantly reduced need for blood transfu-\\nsions compared with patients receiving general anesthesia\\n(28.5% vs 44. 7%; OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.45-0.61; P < .0001) af-\\nter simultaneous bilateral total knee replacement surgery [40].\\n2.2. Risk factors for the development of\\nspinal hematoma\\nThe overall incidences of hematoma in patients receiving\\nneuraxial anesthesia (epidural and spinal) have been estimated\\nto be as low as 1 in 220 000 and 1 in 320 000, respectively, in\\nthe absence of traumatic puncture and without the use ofhep-\\narin or ASA [41]. However, the incidence of spinal hematoma\\nincreases with the presence ofany risk factors, listed in Table 1,\\nand more so ifheparin anticoagulation is accompanied by trau-\\nmatic puncture (increasing incidence rates to 1 in 2000 and 1\\nin 2900 for epidural and spinal anesthesia, respectively). For\\nASA therapy the risk is 1 in 8500 and 1 in 12 000 for epidural\\nand spinal anesthesia, respectively [41,42]. An incidence of\\nbetween 1 in 1000 and 1 in 10 000 has been estimated for neur-\\naxial hematoma after central neural blockade in patients under-\\ngoing orthopedic procedures and receiving preoperative\\nthromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin [43]. A recent review\\nassessing spinal/epidural anesthesia complications in Finland\\nfrom 2000 to 2009 showed the risk of developing a serious\\ncomplication (defined as a potentially fatal event or an event\\nof over 1 year in duration, including epidural hematoma) after\\n226\\nG.

Of the 13 cases of neuraxial hematoma reported\\nfrom a total of 1.4 million procedures involving neuraxial\\ncentral blocks, 10 were associated with thromboprophylaxis\\n(enoxaparin, dalteparin, or fondaparinux); however, for\\n6 of 10 of these occurrences, the time elapsed between\\ncessation/initiation of thromboprophylaxis and puncture may\\nnot have been sufficient to prevent a bleeding event [44]. A\\nrecent retrospective study on the safety of epidural and spinal\\nneuraxial block showed that the incidence of perioperative\\nneurological complications in orthopedic patients was rela-\\ntively low (0.96/1000; 95% CI 0.77-1.16/1000), but was\\nhigher than previously reported in other non-obstetric popula-\\ntions [45]. Risk factors associated with an increased risk of\\nclinically significant bleeding causing spinal hematoma can\\nbe divided into patient-, drug-, and procedure-related catego-\\nries (Table 1).\\n2.3. Patient-related factors increasing the risk of\\nspinal hematoma\\nRegarding patient-related factors, clinicians must exercise\\nparticular care with elderly patients requiring surgical inter-\\nvention- these patients are at increased risk of thrombo-\\nembolic disorders [46,47] and are, therefore, more likely to\\nbe receiving anticoagulants. Furthermore, the bleeding risk in\\nelderly patients receiving anticoagulants is augmented\\n[48,49]. Elderly patients are also more likely to have renal or he-\\npatic impairment, causing increased drug plasma concentrations,\\nand consequently drug elimination may be slower in these\\npatients [50]. Real-world data from the RIETE (Registro Infor-\\nmatizado de Pacientes con Enfermedad TromboEmb�lica)\\nregistry have shown major and fatal bleeding to be more com-\\nmon in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy who were\\naged > 80 years compared with those aged <80 years (3.4%\\nvs 2.1% and 0.8% vs 0.4%, respectively) [51]. Therefore,\\nknowledge about the metabolism ofthe direct OACs approved\\nfor VTE prevention after major orthopedic surgery is essential\\nwhen deciding which anticoagulant to prescribe to a particular\\npatient. Whereas the metabolism of dabigatran is mostly\\ndependent on renal clearance, the metabolism of apixaban\\nand rivaroxaban involves multiple pathways and is less\\ndependent on renal function (Table 2). The high frequency of\\nco-medication use in elderly patients also increases both the\\npotential for drug-drug interactions and the risk ofbleeding [52].\\n2.4. Drug-related factors increasing the risk of\\nspinal hematoma\\nSome drug interactions of anticoagulants might increase the\\nrisk ofbleeding complications, including the risk of spinal hema-\\ntoma.

The most\\nsignificant interactions are those of apixaban and rivaroxaban\\nwith systemic co-administration of strong inhibitors ofboth cyto-\\nchrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (such as the azole-\\nantimycotics ketoconazole and itraconazole and the HIV protease\\ninhibitor ritonavir), which is not recommended [6,10], and\\ndabigatran with amiodarone and verapamil that requires a\\nreduction in the daily dose [8]. For all 3 direct OACs, care\\nshould be taken when co-administering with non-steroidal\\nanti-inflammatory drugs, ASA, or platelet aggregation inhibi-\\ntors, which may increase bleeding risk [6,10].\\n2.5. Procedural-related factors increasing the risk of\\nspinal hematoma\\nThe risk of spinal hematoma has also been associated with\\nprocedural factors, including unintentional needle/catheter-\\nrelated mechanical damage of neural or vascular components\\nof the spine due to a difficult or traumatic spinal procedure\\n[53-55]. The patient characteristics also have an influence\\non procedure-related risk factors; for example, aging is associ-\\nated with skeletal degeneration that may make the anesthesia\\nprocedure technically more difficult [56].\\n3. Influence of anesthesia in patients receiving\\ndirect oral anticoagulants: evidence from\\nphase III clinical studies with a focus on\\nmajor orthopedic surgery\\nGiven the increasing utilization of direct OACs for the\\ntreatment and prevention of thromboembolic disorders, it is\\ncrucial to evaluate the risk of compressive hematoma and the\\nimpact on clinical outcomes when regional anesthesia is used.\\nTo discuss the effect ofregional anesthesia on the risk of com-\\npressive hematoma and bleeding risk, we searched PubMed\\nwith no date restrictions for phase III clinical trials comparing\\n'apixaban : 'rivaroxaban , or 'dabigatran' with 'standard of\\n,\\ncare'/'low molecular weight heparin' for 'VTE prevention'/\\n'thromboprophylaxis' after 'total knee or hip replacement\\nsurgery*/cknee or hip arthroplasty' and for studies investigating\\n'spinal hematoma' after 'regional anesthesia'.\\nIt is worth noting the risk of spinal hematoma with regional\\nanesthesia when receiving traditional anticoagulants. Vitamin\\nK antagonist therapy is a contraindication for neuraxial\\nanesthesia, owing to the high risk ofbleeding associated with\\ntherapeutic doses [57]. The risk of spinal hematoma in patients\\nreceiving low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) concomi-\\ntantly with epidural anesthesia is reported to be 1:6600 for\\nsingle-shot epidural and 1:3100 with an indwelling catheter\\nfor the LMWH dosage of 30 mg twice daily and 1:18 000\\nfor a 40 mg once-daily dosage [57,58]. There are fewer data\\nfor ASA, but it has been demonstrated that medical patients\\nreceiving daily doses above 100 mg are at increased risk of\\nhemorrhagic complications [59].\\nCentral nerve blocks have been classified as a high bleed-\\ning risk procedure owing to their rare but severe complication,\\neg, spinal-epidural hematoma [60,61]. Because of the absence\\nof evidence-based data, when neuraxial procedures are\\nperformed in these conditions, a systematic follow-up of these\\npatients and a heightened awareness ofbleeding complications\\nshould be observed.\\n3.1. Apixaban\\nStudies specifically designed to investigate the relationship\\nbetween anesthesia and spinal hematoma risk in patients\\nreceiving apixaban are lacking. However, phase III clinical\\ntrials comparing apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily) with subcuta-\\nneous enoxaparin (30 mg twice daily or 40 mg once daily)\\nfor VTE prevention after total knee or hip replacement surgery\\nfound that apixaban was as effective as or better than enoxa-\\nparin at reducing the risk of the composite of VTE or death\\nwith similar or lower rates of bleeding [22-24]. In these 3\\ntrials, 15.8% of patients randomized to apixaban had regional\\nanesthesia. Experience of apixaban use in the presence of\\nneuraxial blockade is limited and, according to its product label\\nand guidance from the European Society of Anaesthesiology\\n(ESA), should only be done with extreme caution [6,57].\\n3.2. Rivaroxaban\\nThe incidences of intraspinal bleeding or hemorrhagic\\npuncture were included under the definition for major bleed-\\ning used in the RECORD (REgulation of Coagulation in\\nORthopaedic surgery to prevent Deep vein thrombosis and\\npulmonary embolism) clinical trial program of rivaroxaban\\n[27,62]. A post hoc analysis assessed 12 729 randomized\\npatients in the pooled RECORD1-4 program undergoing elec-\\ntive total knee or hip replacement surgery for events related to\\nneuraxial anesthesia, such as neuraxial hematoma [62].\\nThromboprophylactic therapy was provided to patients as\\neither oral rivaroxaban (10 mg once daily, initiated 6-8 hours\\nafter surgery) or subcutaneous enoxaparin (40 mg once daily,\\nstarted 12 hours prior to surgery, or 30 mg twice daily, started\\n12-24 hours after surgery) [62]. Although 66% of patients\\n(safety population, n = 12 383) received neuraxial anesthesia\\n(9% of patients also received general anesthesia), only 1\\ncompressive hematoma after epidural catheter removal was\\nrecorded. This event occurred after elective total knee replace-\\nment surgery in a patient treated with enoxaparin, who was at\\nincreased risk ofbleeding as a result ofadvanced age and renal\\ninsufficiency. The patient was adequately managed with a\\nlaminectomy without further bleeding or neurological\\ncomplications [62]. The type of anesthesia (spinal with or\\nwithout general anesthesia, epidural, epidural with indwelling\\ncatheter, general or spinal with femoral block, or general\\nalone) had no influence on the rates of total venous thrombo-\\nembolic events, which were lower with rivaroxaban than with\\nstandard of care [62].\\n228\\nG. Cappelleri, A. Fanelli\\nIn the RECORD posthoc subanalysis, the incidence oftotal\\nvenous thromboembolic events (the composite of any DVT,\\nnon-fatal PE, and all-cause mortality) and safety profiles were\\nsimilar irrespective of the type of anesthesia used. Neuraxial\\nanesthesia was associated with a slightly lower rate of\\nsymptomatic thromboembolic events compared with general\\nanesthesia in patients undergoing elective total knee or hip\\nreplacement surgery [62]. However, available experience\\nusing rivaroxaban with neuraxial blockade remains limited,\\nand real risk is difficult to evaluate owing to the low incidences\\nof spinal and epidural hematoma in this setting. The ESA\\nguidelines, published before the completion of the relevant\\nRECORD subanalysis, recommend extreme caution when\\nusing rivaroxaban with neuraxial blockade [57]. The\\nAmerican Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine\\n(ASRA) guidelines for dabigatran, as well as rivaroxaban,\\nare still being evaluated. These guidelines do not provide\\ndetailed information for the management of anticoagulation\\nwith direct OACs owing to a lack of available information\\non block performance [41].\\n3.3. Dabigatran\\nAn analysis of the pooled population of patients from the\\nphase III RE-MODEL, RE-NOVATE, and RE-MOBILIZE\\nstudies who underwent major hip or knee replacement surgery\\nand received thromboprophylaxis with dabigatran (220 mg or\\n150 mg once daily) or enoxaparin showed a higher use ofneur-\\naxial anesthesia (n = 4212; 52%) compared with general anes-\\nthesia (n = 2311; 29%) or combination anesthesia, namely,\\nneuraxial or general anesthesia combined with a peripheral\\nnerve block (n = 1539; 19%) [63]. The use of neuraxial anes-\\nthesia was not associated with neuraxial hematoma-no cases\\nwere reported [63]. The efficacy and safety outcomes of the\\ndabigatran groups did not differ from those of the standard\\ntherapy groups, and were not significantly influenced by the\\ntype of anesthesia used [63]. A reduced incidence of major\\nVTE and VTE-related mortality was observed with neuraxial\\nanesthesia compared with general anesthesia (4.2% vs 3.1%;\\nOR 1.40; 95% CI 1.03-1.90; P = .035) in the overall population,\\nbut no significant differences or clear trends were recorded\\nregarding the safety outcomes of major bleeding or major\\nand non-major clinically relevant bleeding between the types\\nof anesthesia [63]. Experience with combined use of neuraxial\\nblockade and dabigatran is restricted by its manufacturer's\\nadvice against this, as stated by the ESA guidelines [8,57].\\n4. Management of direct oral anticoagulants and\\nneuraxial anesthesia in major orthopedic surgery\\nManagement strategies must balance the surgical risk of\\nhematoma in the anesthetized patient with effective thrombo-\\nprophylaxis. Understanding the pharmacodynamic and\\npharmacokinetic properties of an anticoagulant and the influ-\\nence ofpatient age and hepatic and renal function is essential.\\nProviding neuraxial anesthesia and the timing ofneedle/catheter\\ninsertion/removal in patients who are receiving or are to receive\\nanticoagulant therapy involves individual assessment of the\\nrisks and benefits of such a procedure, together with rigorous\\nmanagement of anticoagulation activity and monitoring for\\nsigns of neurological dysfunction. It is of the utmost importance\\nto ensure that the anticoagulation effect is adequately reduced\\nbefore proceeding with a neuraxial block. It is possible to\\nmeasure the effect of the direct OACs either qualitatively or\\nquantitatively, if required.\\n4.1. Perioperative management of direct\\noral anticoagulants\\nAdequate protocols for interrupting and resuming thrombo-\\nprophylaxis based on the pharmacokinetic properties ofthe direct\\nOACs are essential. Clinical practice guidelines, such as those of\\nthe ESA [57]), ASRA [41], and the Scandinavian Society of\\nAnaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (SSAI) [64], pro-\\nvide recommendations for the regional anesthetic management\\nof patients undergoing surgery and requiring anticoagulation,\\nincluding with direct OACs (Table 3). These recommenda-\\ntions, based on data from clinical trials, the pharmacokinetic\\nprofile of each anticoagulant, and from clinical experience, ad-\\nvise a waiting time between interrupting anticoagulation and\\nperforming neuraxial blockade that depends on the elimination\\nhalf-life of the anticoagulant agent [57]. The percentages of\\ndrug remaining in the circulation after 1-6 half-lives are\\n50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.3%, 3.1%, and 1.6%, respectively [65].\\nA recommendation for a waiting period of2 half-lives, to re-\\nduce the bioavailability of an anticoagulant to less than 25%,\\ndoes not take into consideration how the half-life elimination\\nof a drug is influenced by patient characteristics. Patients\\nwho undergo joint replacement surgery are typically elderly,\\noften with renal impairment and receiving antiplatelet therapy;\\nfor these patients, a waiting time of 3-5 half-lives could be\\nmore appropriate ifhemostatic safety is not assured (Table 4).\\nTo prevent VTE after major orthopedic surgery, the direct\\nOACs have to be administered in the postoperative period\\nwhen adequate hemostasis has been established, as determined\\nby the treating physician.\\nRecently, the direct OACs have been approved for long-term\\nprevention of thromboembolic events in non-valvular AF, and\\nfor the treatment and secondary prophylaxis of VTE. Every\\nyear, 15%-20% of patients receiving therapeutic doses of anti-\\ncoagulants require perioperative temporary interruption, and\\nthe characteristics ofboth the patients and the procedures should\\nbe considered when scheduling interruption and resumption.\\n4.1.1.

There is no clinical experience\\nwith the use of apixaban with indwelling intrathecal or epidu-\\nral catheters [6]. However, if required, the recommendation\\nprovided by the Summary ofProduct Characteristics is to wait\\n20-30 hours (considering 2 times its elimination half-life) be-\\ntween interruption of anticoagulation therapy and neuraxial\\npuncture/catheter removal, with at least 1 dose being omitted\\n[6,66]. The ESA recommends 26-30 hours between stopping\\nanticoagulation and conducting a neuraxial anesthesia proce-\\ndure for management of anticoagulation with apixaban in the\\ncontext of elective orthopedic surgery [57].\\n4.1.1.2. Resumption of apixaban after surgery. The Sum-\\nmary ofProduct Characteristics of apixaban recommends start-\\ning thromboprophylaxis 12-24 hours after the end of surgery,\\nprovided hemostasis is achieved and allowing for a waiting\\nperiod of at least 5 hours to re-initiate treatment after catheter\\nremoval [6]. The ESA recommends 4-6 hours between cathe-\\nter removal and initiation of anticoagulation, for management\\nof anticoagulation with apixaban in the context of elective\\northopedic surgery [57]. No further recommendations were\\nprovided by the ASRA for management of anticoagulation\\nwith apixaban in the context of elective orthopedic surgery\\n[41]. The SSAI guidelines state that the lack of data prevents\\nany recommendation being made regarding the use of apixa-\\nban and central neuraxial block, although a period of 6 hours\\nshould be observed between central neuraxial block or catheter\\nmanipulation and first dose of this anticoagulant [64].\\n4.1.2. Perioperative management of rivaroxaban\\n4.1.2.1. Interruption of rivaroxaban before surgery. The\\nSummary of Product Characteristics of rivaroxaban suggest\\nin patients with normal renal function a minimum of24 hours\\nbetween the last therapeutic dose of the anticoagulant and the\\nstart of the surgery [10]. For patients with severe renal impair-\\nment, many authors recommend an interval of up to 4-5 days\\n[60,67,68]. Imberti et al suggested a discontinuation of rivar-\\noxaban at least 48 hours prior to procedures involving a\\nstandard risk of bleeding, such as orthopedic surgery; for\\nprocedures with a high risk of bleeding (neuraxial block),\\nrivaroxaban should be stopped 72 hours before the intervention\\n[69]. In the authors' opinion, patients with AF with standard\\nbleeding risk (HAS-BLED score <3) could undergo neuraxial\\nanesthesia 48 hours after the last rivaroxaban intake, whereas\\nin patients with high bleeding risk, neuraxial anesthesia should\\nbe delayed for 4 days, and this type of anesthesia should not be\\nconsidered in cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine\\nclearance <30 mL min- 1) [69].\\nIn patients receiving ongoing rivaroxaban, ifa central block\\nwith an indwelling catheter is used, the SSAI guidelines\\nrecommend a minimum of 18 hours between the last dose of\\nrivaroxaban and removal of an indwelling catheter [64].\\nBecause of the prolongation ofthe half-life in elderly patients,\\nthe ESA guidelines recommend a longer interval (22-26 hours)\\nbetween the last dose of rivaroxaban and removal of an\\nindwelling catheter [57]. These 2 recommendations are in\\nagreement with those in the report by Rosencher et al, which\\nrecommends 2 half-lives between rivaroxaban discontinuation\\nand epidural catheter removal [66]. Furthermore, these guide-\\nlines highlight the fact that patients receiving anti-hemostatic\\ndrugs and with impaired drug elimination, such as those with\\nrenal impairment, may require waiting times to be prolonged\\n[64]. The ASRA guidelines issued for rivaroxaban recom-\\nmend a cautious approach owing to the lack of information\\non the specifics (needle placement or catheter management)\\nofblock performance and the prolonged half-life in elderly pa-\\ntients resulting from deterioration ofrenal function, even in the\\nabsence of any reported spinal hematoma [41].\\n4.1.2.2. Resumption of rivaroxaban after surgery. Rivar-\\noxaban should be started 6-10 hours after the end of surgery,\\nprovided hemostasis is achieved [10]. The SSAI guidelines\\nrecommend a minimum of 6 hours between central neuraxial\\nblock and initiation of rivaroxaban, or a delay of 24 hours if\\na traumatic puncture occurred during the performance of\\ncentral nerve block [10,64]. The ESA recommends an interval\\nTable 4 Half-lives of direct oral anticoagulant drugs and recommended interval between discontinuation and surgery or neuraxial procedure, set as 2-3 half-lives or 4-5 half-lives depending\\non the bleeding risk of the surgical procedure and the level of anticoagulant effect permitted at surgery [65,67,68].\\nDrug Variation of elimination half-life values (h) a [65] Bleeding risk of surgical procedure Anticoagulant residual effect at surgery\\n Low bleeding risk surgery (2-3 half-lives) [67] Days between last dose and surgery [67] High bleeding risk surgery (4-5 half-lives) [67] Days between last dose and surgery [67] Mild to moderate anticoagulant effect (2-3 half-lives) [68] Days between last dose and surgery [68] No or minimal anticoagulant effect (4-5 half-lives) [68] Days between last dose and surgery [68]\\n Apixaban 15 -1 b CrCl >50 mL min 2 d 50 mL min 1 CrCl > 3 d CrCl >50 mL min 1 2 d CrCl > 50 mL min 1 3 d\\n -1 CrCl 30-50 mL min 3 d / 1 CrCl 30-50 mL min 4 d - 1 CrCl 30-50 mL min 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min -1 4-5 d\\n Rivaroxaban 5-13 -1 c CrCl > 50 mL min 2 d CrCl > 50 mL min -1 3 d 1 CrCl >50 mL min 2 d CrCl >50 mL min 1 3 d\\n - 1 CrCl 30-50 mL min 2 d - 1 CrCl 30-50 mL min 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min - 1 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min -1 4-5 d\\n -1 CrCl 15-29.9 mL min 3 d 1 15-29.9 mL min CrCl 4 d    \\n Dabigatran 12-17; -1 e CrCl >50 mL min 2 d -1 CrCl > 50 mL min 3 d CrCl >50 mL min -1 2 d CrCl >50 mL min -1 3 d\\n 28 d -1 CrCl 30-50 mL min 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min - 1 4-5 d CrCl 30-50 mL min -1 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min -1 4-5 d\\nCrCl = creatinine clearance.\\na Half-lives differ from those in the Summary of Product Characteristics of each agent.\\nb 1 CrCl 30-50 mL min considered as 7-8 and 17-18 hours, respectively.\\n1\\nApixaban (5 mg twice daily) half-life for CrCl >50 mL min and\\n1 1 15-29 mL min -1 considered as 8-9, 9 and 9-10.5 hours, respectively.\\nC Rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) half-life for CrCl>50 mL min , CrCl 30-50 mL min and CrCl\\nd End-stage renal disease.\\ne Dabigatran (150 mg twice daily) half-life for CrCl>50 mL min-1 and CrCl 30-50 mL min-1 considered as 14-17 and 16-18 hours, respectively.\\nG.\\nCappelleri,\\nA.\\nFanelli\\n231\\nAnticoagulation and anesthesia\\nof 4-6 hours between epidural catheter removal and the next\\ndose ofrivaroxaban [57].

Interruption of dabigatran before surgery.\\ndabigatran Summary of Product Characteristics recommends\\ndiscontinuation of the anticoagulant for ≥ 2 days before elec-\\ntive surgery that carries a high risk ofbleeding or is considered\\nto be 'major' surgery, depending on the patient's renal\\nfunction [8]. High-risk procedures, including cardiac surgery,\\nneurosurgery, abdominal surgery, or procedures requiring\\nspinal anesthesia, may require cessation ofdabigatran 2-4 days\\nbefore surgery in patients with normal renal function and > 4\\ndays before surgery in patients with moderate renal impair-\\nment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL min- 1) [70]. Based on\\nthe pharmacokinetic characteristics of dabigatran, a time inter-\\nval of36 hours (skipping 1 dose) between the last dose ofdabi-\\ngatran and puncture/catheter removal is suggested [66], but\\nthis has not been studied or confirmed.\\n4.1.3.2. Resumption of dabigatran after surgery. Pro-\\nvided hemostasis is achieved, dabigatran should be started 1-4\\nhours after the end of surgery [8]. The ESA guidelines recom-\\nmend against the use ofdabigatran in the presence ofneuraxial\\nblockade, as also advised in the dabigatran Summary of\\nProduct Characteristics [8]. If neuraxial anesthesia is used,\\nthe first dose of dabigatran should not be administered within\\n2 hours of catheter removal, in accordance with the Summary\\nof Product Characteristics [8]. The ESA guidelines recom-\\nmend a waiting time of 6 hours after catheter removal before\\nre-initiating anticoagulation with dabigatran [57]. However,\\nthe ASRA guidelines state simply that caution must be taken\\nowing to the paucity of information on the performance of\\nneuraxial block and the prolonged half-life of this anticoagu-\\nlant after multiple doses or in patients with renal impairment,\\ndespite the absence of spinal hematomas reported up to the\\npublication of these guidelines [41]. The SSAI guidelines\\nmake the sole recommendation of waiting for at least 6 hours\\nafter a central neuraxial block or catheter removal before\\nthe first dose of dabigatran is taken [64]. However, based on\\nthe pharmacokinetic characteristics of dabigatran, it may be\\nprudent to wait at least 12 hours after catheter removal before\\nadministration of dabigatran [66].\\n4.2. Laboratory measurement of direct\\noral anticoagulants\\nIn the context ofperioperative management ofpatients who\\nare receiving a direct OAC, the concentration of the direct\\nOAC can be determined if, for example, an emergency\\nsurgical intervention is required by an anticoagulated patient.\\nHowever, it is important to take into account the timing of\\nthe last dose in relation to blood sampling time when interpreting\\nthe test results [71].\\n4.2.1. Laboratory measurement of apixaban\\nThe quantitative measurement of plasma concentrations of\\napixaban can be performed using anti-Factor Xa chromogenic\\nassays and adequate standard calibration curves [72].\\nAlthough apixaban prolongs prothrombin time (PT), it is not\\nsuitable for measuring the anticoagulant effect of apixaban\\nand there is no known relationship with bleeding risk [71].\\n4.2.2. Laboratory measurement of rivaroxaban\\nThe PT can be used to determine the relative anticoagulant\\nactivity of rivaroxaban [71,73]. However, PT is not specific\\nand can be influenced by factors such as cancer, hepatic\\nimpairment, and vitamin K deficiency [74,75]. Furthermore,\\nthere is marked variability in the sensitivity of the reagents\\navailable for obtaining PT results for rivaroxaban; only a\\nsensitive reagent, such as Neoplastin Plus (Diagnostica Stago,\\nAsnieres-sur-Seine, France), should be used [76]. Importantly,\\nthe international normalized ratio must not be used for rivarox-\\naban. The quantitative measurement of plasma concentrations\\nof rivaroxaban can be performed using anti-Factor Xa\\nchromogenic assays (eg, STA Rotachrom, Diagnostica Stago,\\nAsnieres-sur-Seine, France) with validated calibrators [77].\\nWhen anti-Factor Xa assays are unavailable, a PT test with a\\nreagent sensitive to rivaroxaban may be used to confirm the\\nabsence or presence of an anticoagulant effect (if the sampling\\ntime after last tablet intake is known) [76,78,79].\\n4.2.3. Laboratory measurement of dabigatran\\nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay, for\\nexample, provides a qualitative measure of the anticoagulant\\neffect of dabigatran [73]. Unfortunately, aPTT is influenced\\nby the coagulometers and reagents used [75]. In the case of\\naPTT results for dabigatran, there is reasonable agreement\\nregardless of the reagent composition, and results are within\\n10% of reference measurements [70]. The aPTT assay may be\\nuseful in dabigatran-treated patients who require emergency\\ninterventions to exclude any clinically relevant dabigatran\\nanticoagulant effect [71,80]. The ecarin clotting time (ECT)\\nassay provides a direct measurement of the activity of dabiga-\\ntran, but is not readily available [71]. Calibrated ecarin chro-\\nmogenic assays are also available (eg, Ecarin Chromogenic\\nAssay, Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres-sur-Seine, France) and\\nmay allow faster ECT measurements than the ECT assay\\n[71]. Direct thrombin inhibitor assays (such as the\\nHEMOCLOT assay, HYPHEN BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise,\\nFrance) can be used for the quantitative measurement of\\nplasma concentrations of dabigatran [81]. In the absence of\\nthis assay, an aPTT test can be used [82].\\n5. Neurological complications and\\nregional anesthesia\\nDevelopment ofneurological complications is a major con-\\ncern in cases ofregional anesthesia in patients receiving direct\\n232\\nG. Cappelleri, A. Fanelli\\nOACs (eg, for stroke prevention). Assessment of neurological\\nfunction is the most reliable method for detecting neurological\\ninjury, because standard laboratory tests may not provide ade-\\nquate information about the coagulation status of a patient\\n[83,84]. Monitoring of neurological function during regional\\nanesthesia alongside anticoagulant therapy is essential-but\\nmay not be sufficient-to improve neurological outcomes.\\nBased on the pharmacokinetic properties of the direct OACs\\nand their rapid onset of action (within a few hours), confining\\nthe assessment of neurological function to the period between\\ncatheter removal or neuraxial puncture and 4 hours after\\nthe initiation of therapy may seem reasonable. However, a\\nlonger period of time during which neurological function\\nshould be assessed may be required, because the development\\nof neurological injury may be slow, with the onset of\\nneurological symptoms potentially taking as long as 3 or more\\ndays [55].\\n6. Use of non-neuraxial regional techniques and\\ndirect oral anticoagulants in clinical practice\\nTotal knee and hip replacement surgery causes intense\\npostoperative pain, which may impair rehabilitation and mobi-\\nlization, prolong hospitalization, and increase the risk of VTE\\n[85]. The use of continuous peripheral nerve blocks (femoral\\nand lumbar plexus blocks) for hip and knee surgery may offer\\nadvantages as a first strategy to balance the risk of hematoma\\nin anticoagulated patients compared with epidural analgesia.\\nThe results from a systematic review ofrandomized controlled\\ntrials support the use of peripheral nerve blocks as a first\\nchoice of analgesia after major orthopedic surgery; femoral\\nnerve block provided a similar analgesic profile to epidural\\nanalgesia, with fewer side-effects after total knee replacement sur-\\ngery [86]. Lumbar plexus block represents the first analgesic\\nchoice after total hip replacement surgery [87]. However, both\\nlumbar plexus and femoral nerve blocks are still associated\\nwith loss of quadricep muscle strength [88,89]. A study has\\nsuggested that an adductor canal block after knee surgery\\nmay provide a similar analgesic profile but without quadricep\\nweakness after total knee replacement surgery [88]. Although\\nno difference was observed between the 2 anesthesia tech-\\nniques in terms of morphine use or level of pain, quadricep\\nstrength was significantly better preserved with an adductor\\ncanal block than with a femoral nerve block (52% median of\\nbaseline VS 18%, P = 004) [88]. Peripheral nerve blocks have\\nbeen associated with a potential for wound hematoma with\\nadministration of heparin in some studies [57,90-93] but not\\nothers [94]. The potential severity of a hematoma in a non-\\ncompressible site and the lack of evidence on which to base\\nrecommendations for the particular use of continuous periph-\\neral nerve blocks have led the ESA and ASRA guidelines to\\nsuggest expanding the clinical recommendations for neuraxial\\nanesthesia to deeper peripheral nerve blocks, such as lumbar\\nplexus [41,57].\\nStudies specifically investigating the use of apixaban after\\nnon-neuraxial blocks in orthopedic surgery seem to be lacking.\\nHowever, there are some available data for rivaroxaban\\nand dabigatran. In a prospective observational study of 504\\npatients undergoing total knee replacement surgery who had\\ncontinuous femoral nerve block and whose femoral catheter\\nwas removed 20 hours after starting rivaroxaban (10 mg once\\ndaily), no incidences of hematoma causing neurovascular\\ncompromise at the femoral catheter site or groin area were\\nreported [95]. Neither was rivaroxaban associated with an\\nincrease in major bleeding in an observational analysis of\\n766 patients undergoing total knee or hip replacement surgery\\nand femoral, sciatic, and lumbar plexus blocks, although 3\\nhematomas in the operated knee requiring surgical evacuation\\nwere noted during rivaroxaban administration [96].\\nIn a post hoc pooled analysis of3 phase III clinical trials of\\ndabigatran (220 mg or 150 mg once daily) versus enoxaparin\\nfor VTE prevention after knee or hip replacement surgery, in\\nwhich 19% (n = 1539) received a combination of general anes-\\nthesia or neuraxial anesthesia plus peripheral nerve block, rates\\nof major VTE and VTE-related mortality were slightly higher\\nwith general anesthesia compared with neuraxial or combina-\\ntion anesthesia, although not significantly so, and neither were\\nthere significant differences in efficacy or safety outcomes\\nbetween dabigatran and enoxaparin [63].\\n7. Conclusions\\nPatients undergoing elective major orthopedic surgery\\nreceive thromboprophylaxis because of their increased risk\\nof developing VTE. With the overall aging of the population,\\nmore patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery are likely\\nto be receiving anticoagulation therapy for thromboembolic\\ndisorders prior to their surgical procedure. Several direct\\nOACs are currently approved for different therapeutic indica-\\ntions, including prevention of VTE after elective knee or hip\\nreplacement surgery, and their use in clinical practice has been\\ngrowing. Effective management of these direct OACs and\\nregional anesthesia is essential to avoid bleeding complica-\\ntions and is, therefore, a topic of crucial interest for anesthesi-\\nologists. Thromboprophylaxis with all direct OACs may start\\nbetween 1 and 24 hours after surgery [6,8,10], provided that\\nhemostasis has been achieved, and thus should present a lower\\ntheoretical risk of bleeding or neuraxial hematoma in case of\\ncentral blocks, in comparison with preoperatively initiated\\nLMWH. After surgery, restarting direct OACs can be delayed\\nby up to 48 hours in cases of bleeding or a difficult neuraxial\\nblock, and protection against thromboembolic events is\\nachieved within hours after the first dose of these agents and\\nwithout the need for bridging therapy. The effect of the type\\nof anesthesia on clinical outcomes of the direct OACs is still\\nunclear. Subanalyses of RE-MODEL, RE-NOVATE, and\\nRE-MOBILIZE data suggest that, irrespective of the anesthe-\\nsia used, neuraxial anesthesia was associated with a lower risk\\nAnticoagulation and anesthesia\\n233\\nof thromboembolic events and VTE-related mortality than\\ngeneral anesthesia [63]. Conversely, a subanalysis of pooled\\nRECORD data found no significant difference in the risk of\\nvenous thromboembolic events between these types of\\nanesthesia used [62]. A growing body of clinical study and\\nreal-world data, particularly with rivaroxaban, suggests that\\nneuraxial anesthesia can be undertaken in patients undergoing\\nmajor orthopedic surgery without increasing the risk of\\ncompressive hematoma, provided that guideline recommenda-\\ntions are followed and bleeding risk is evaluated on an individ-\\nual basis.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Li Wan for\\neditorial support, with funding from Bayer HealthCare\\nPharmaceuticals and Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.\\nReferences\\n[1] Deitelzweig SB, Johnson BH, Lin J, Schulman KL.

Patients with\\nepileptic seizures had a 2.5 to 3-fold higher death rate, and hospital stay\\nwas twice as long. The administration of TXA has been shown to be an\\nindependent predictor of seizures, correlated with higher doses [26,27].'},\n",

Introduction</h1>\\n<p id=\\'24\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>Cardiac surgery carries a high risk of peri-operative bleeding [1], as<br>evidenced by the high proportion (50-60%) of cardiac surgical patients<br>who require allogeneic blood transfusion during and after surgery [2,3].<br>The risk of bleeding in cardiac surgery is affected by numerous factors:<br>invasiveness of the procedure; use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet<br>medication; use of hypothermia; and use of cardiopulmonary bypass<br>(CPB) [1]. Several factors have been associated with an increased risk of<br>bleeding such as advanced age, poor platelet function, preoperative<br>anaemia, small body size, female sex, non-elective surgery, and repeat<br>surgery [1].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'25\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>Peri-operative bleeding has been shown to be an independent pre-<br>dictor of hospital mortality. In a study including more than 9000 pa-<br>tients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, massive blood loss (defined<br>by the transfusion of at least five units of packed red blood cells on the<br>day of surgery) was associated with an 8-fold increase in mortality [4].<br>Other studies have also reported excess morbidity, particularly in terms<br>of thromboembolic complications, infections and higher rates of surgical<br>re-exploration [5]. Notably, surgical re-exploration and transfusion<br>following bleeding are also associated with increased infection, mor-<br>tality, and a longer stay in ICU and hospital [2,6]. Finally, excessive<br>postoperative haemorrhage in cardiac surgery has a significant eco-<br>nomic impact: a retrospective German analysis of more than 1100 pa-<br>tients estimated its average additional cost to be 66251 per patient [7].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'26\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>The concept of patient blood management (PBM), defined by the<br>World Health Organization as a \"patient-focused, evidence based and<br>systematic approach for optimising the management of patients and<br>transfusion of blood products to ensure high quality and effective patient<br>care\" [8] includes an anaesthetic, pharmacological and surgical<br>approach. It is based on three pillars: optimization of blood mass,<br>minimization of blood loss and optimization of patient tolerance to<br>anaemia. In cardiac surgery, the use of antifibrinolytics is an essential<br>component of the pharmacological approach in PBM and follows rec-<br>ommendations from the European Association for Cardiothoracic Sur-<br>gery (EACTS) and the European Association of Cardiothoracic<br>Anaesthesiology (EACTA) [1].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'27\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>This review provides an overview of the major role of fibrinolysis in<br>haemostatic disorders after cardiac surgery and how it influences their<br>management, compares the current available guidelines in PBM and<br>analyses the place of different antifibrinolytics in cardiac surgery in<br>Europe, according to these guidelines.</p>\\n<p id=\\'28\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>2.

Haemostatic disorders induced by cardiac surgery</p>\\n<p id=\\'30\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>CPB used during cardiac surgery leads to activation of the coagula-<br>tion system due to blood coming into contact with foreign surfaces such<br>as plastic [9,10]. Thus, by the end of CPB, a significant proportion of<br>coagulation factors will have been consumed; fibrinogen levels are<br>decreased by approximately 40% [9] and platelets are activated,<br>consumed and show a selective loss of alpha granules. In contrast,<br>thrombin levels are elevated, which is not the case in other types of<br>surgery [10]. Along with activating the generation of fibrin, thrombin is<br>also an activator of fibrinolysis.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'31\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>Generally, fibrinolysis is a protective physiological response, pro-<br>portionately inhibiting excess clot formation. However, after massive<br>trauma, surgery, or with the use of CPB, local regulation of this response<br>may be overwhelmed, so that the systemic and simultaneous production<br>of thrombin and plasmin induces consumption coagulopathy, which<br>prevents the formation of a stable clot, resulting in bleeding [11,12].<br>Fibrinolysis is also associated with impaired platelet function during and<br>after CPB due to the action of plasmin and tissue plasminogen activator<br>(tPA) [11]. tPA is responsible for inhibition of platelet aggregation, and<br>high plasmin levels can cause damage to platelets through cleavage of</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'32\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>the GPIb receptor and triggering their partial activation, thus inducing a<br>loss of responsiveness to further activation [13,14] (Fig. 1). Thus,<br>fibrinolysis plays a major role in the pathophysiology of haemorrhage<br>during cardiac surgery, as evidenced by the strong correlation of fibri-<br>nolytic markers and the magnitude of blood loss after CPB [9,15].</p>\\n<p id=\\'33\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>2.2. Antifibrinolytic treatment</p>\\n<p id=\\'34\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:22px\\'>Antifibrinolytic drugs inhibit fibrinolysis and, when administered<br>prophylactically, help prevent peri-operative bleeding [16,17].<br>Commonly used antifibrinolytics include protease inhibitors (aprotinin)<br>and lysine analogues (tranexamic acid (TXA) and �-aminocaproic acid<br>(EACA)).</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'35\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>Aprotinin is a potent inhibitor of free plasmin which has a limited<br>effect on physiological fibrinolysis [9,18]. Aprotinin is a broad-spectrum<br>protease inhibitor, which also interacts with various other plasma pro-<br>teases such as trypsin, kallikrein and elastase. Among the anti-<br>fibrinolytics, it has the most potent activity [1,12]. It also has an anti-<br>inflammatory effect decreasing systemic inflammation after CPB [19].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'36\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>Lysine analogues are currently the most widely used anti-<br>fibrinolytics. These synthetic derivatives of lysine inhibit fibrinolysis by<br>preventing the formation of plasmin through their capacity to bind to<br>plasminogen at the lysine binding site, thus preventing its binding to<br>fibrin [11,18] (Fig. 2).</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'37\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>The prophylactic administration of antifibrinolytics in surgery has<br>been widely researched and discussed. Antifibrinolytics reduce peri and<br>post-operative bleeding, transfusions, re-operations as well as<br>morbidity, mortality, and associated costs, without increasing the inci-<br>dence of acute graft thrombosis or thromboembolism [20]. Data suggest<br>that aprotinin has an advantage over lysine analogues in reducing peri-<br>and post-operative blood loss [21]. When trial results for the two lysine<br>analogues were combined and compared with aprotinin alone, aprotinin<br>was found to be slightly more effective in reducing the need for red<br>blood cell transfusion. The data from 150 trials performed in cardiac<br>surgery in more than 17,000 patients are consistent with these results<br>[21] (Table 1).</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'38\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>In 2008, aprotinin was withdrawn from the market following the<br>publication of observational studies that reported an increased risk of<br>adverse cardiological, neurological and renal events [9,22], as well as<br>the preliminary results from a comparative, randomized, double-blind<br>study (the BART trial), which raised suspicion of excess mortality<br>linked to aprotinin [23]. However, thereafter, numerous methodological<br>flaws were found in these analyses that could have influenced their re-<br>sults. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of data from 88 trials including over<br>15,000 patients found no increased risk of mortality associated with<br>aprotinin compared with other antifibrinolytics [24]. In 2012, after re-<br>evaluation of the data, the European Medicines Agency (EMA)<br>concluded that: \"the data from the BART study concerning excess<br>mortality associated with aprotinin were not reliable\" and lifted the<br>suspension of aprotinin\\'s marketing authorization, but restricted its<br>indication to the prophylactic use in adult patients at high risk of major<br>bleeding undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) sur-<br>gery [25].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'39\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>For the lysine analogues, attention has recently been drawn to the<br>possible but rare occurrence of epileptic seizures [9]. A large retro-<br>spective study of over 11,000 patients undergoing CPB reported an<br>incidence of seizures of 0.9% in those treated with TXA. Patients with<br>epileptic seizures had a 2.5 to 3-fold higher death rate, and hospital stay<br>was twice as long. The administration of TXA has been shown to be an<br>independent predictor of seizures, correlated with higher doses [26,27].</p>\\n<p id=\\'40\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>3.

The use of antifibrinolytics is mentioned to<br>avoid the need for transfusion during elective surgery, notably TXA for<br>patients with high risk of bleeding. The following year, the European<br>Commission published a guide for building national PBM programs for<br>health authorities and for hospitals inside the EU [29,30]. This guide<br>defines the basics of PBM, presents some successful non-European PBM<br>initiatives and identifies current gaps and limiting factors in the<br>implementation of PBM at a large scale (lack of PBM awareness, lack of<br>undergraduate education on PBM and transfusion in nursing and med-<br>ical schools, lack of coordinated patient care, etc.). This guide is to be<br>used as a tool setting the framework for national authorities to support<br>the implementation and dissemination of PBM programs across Europe.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'65\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>At the European level, an update of the \"Management of severe<br>perioperative bleeding\" guidelines was published in 2017 by the ESAIC<br>[31]. These general PBM recommendations are not focused on cardiac<br>surgery; nevertheless, the management of cardiac surgical patients is<br>discussed. The recommendations are classified according to the GRADE<br>(Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evalua-<br>tion) system. In cardiovascular surgery, the authors recommend the<br>prophylactic administration of TXA before CPB in patients undergoing<br>CABG (level of evidence (LoE) 1A). Besides, topical application of TXA<br>to the chest cavity in order to reduce blood loss following cardiac sur-<br>gery is also suggested (LoE 2C). Aprotinin is mentioned throughout the<br>document, with comparison of the efficacy data from several clinical<br>trials. No detailed protocol or dosing regimens for the use of anti-<br>fibrinolytics (either TXA or aprotinin) is provided in these guidelines<br>and the indications for the use of aprotinin are not defined.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'66\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>European PBM guidelines specifically dedicated to cardiac surgery<br>were published jointly in 2018 by the EACTS and the EACTA [1]. The<br>recommendations are divided according to the three steps of the surgical<br>procedure: preoperative management, intraoperative management, and<br>postoperative management. During the preoperative phase, the authors<br>suggest a potential interest for point-of-care (POC) testing, which is<br>meant to predict perioperative bleeding. Thus, a preoperative assess-<br>ment of some specific haemostasis parameters has been proposed<br>(standard laboratory testing, viscoelastic testing and/or platelet func-<br>tion evaluation). The recommendations are as follow: 1/ preoperative<br>levels of fibrinogen may be considered to identify patients at high-risk of<br>bleeding (Class IIb - level C), and 2/ platelet function testing may be<br>considered only in patients who recently received P2Y12 inhibitors or<br>who have ongoing dual antiplatelet therapy, to guide the decision on the<br>timing of cardiac surgery (Class IIb - Level B). In the perioperative<br>setting, treatment algorithms based on viscoelastic POC tests should be<br>considered in order to reduce the number of transfusions for the<br>bleeding patient (Class IIa - Level B).</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'67\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>Antifibrinolytics (TXA, aprotinin or EACA) are recommended during<br>the intraoperative period to reduce blood loss and the need for trans-<br>fusion, and also to reduce the risk of reoperation for bleeding (TXA and<br>aprotinin) (level of evidence 1A). No therapeutic protocols or dosing<br>regimens for the use of antifibrinolytics are recommended. Finally, the<br>implementation of a PBM protocol for bleeding patients is recommended<br>(LoE1C).</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'68\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>3.3.

The United Kingdom</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'101\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>The UK has several guidelines, each dealing with a particular aspect<br>of PBM. A short document entitled \"Patient blood management an<br>evidence-based approach to patient care, published in 2014 by the<br>National Blood Transfusion Committee (NBTC) and the NHS (National<br>Health Service) [38] provides recommendations for the implementation<br>of PBM, but not specific to cardiac surgery. TXA is cited as a pharma-<br>cological drug to be used to reduce blood loss in intraoperative man-<br>agement, and in case of major bleeding. Nevertheless, no specific<br>protocol on the use of TXA is proposed or discussed. The British Com-<br>mittee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) published two different<br>guidelines in 2015, under the GRADE rating system. The first covers the<br>identification and management of preoperative anaemia [39], and the<br>second covers haematological management of major bleeding [40] and<br>provides an overview of the organisational principles, transfusion of<br>different blood products, pharmacological agents and addresses<br>different specific situations. TXA and aprotinin are discussed, but only<br>the use ofTXA is recommended in case of major bleeding after injury, 1 g<br>intravenously over 10 min, followed by a maintenance administration of<br>1 g over 8 h (LoE1A). In non-traumatic major haemorrhage, the use of<br>TXA should be considered but not aprotinin (LoE1B). Regarding the<br>prevention of bleeding in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery,<br>the authors recommended initial administration of TXA (10 mg.kg-1)<br>followed by 1 mg.kg 1 h -1 bleeding (LoE1B). Finally,<br>to prevent<br>guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and<br>Ireland (AAGBI) were published in 2016, which address the use of blood<br>products and their alternatives [41]. They are not focused on cardiac<br>surgery but devote a chapter specifically to it. PBM measures are rec-<br>ommended in patients who are at high risk of bleeding, and TXA and<br>aprotinin are mentioned. TXA is recommended to be used as a 1 g bolus,<br>with an additional infusion of 500 mg.h 1 that could be considered.<br>Aprotinin is recommended in case of myocardial revascularisation, as<br>licensed.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\'102\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>4. Discussion</h1>\\n<p id=\\'103\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>In March 2011, the WHO held a \"Global Forum on Blood Safety:<br>Patient Blood Management\" aimed at establishing a framework for the<br>WHO Member States to actively support PBM dissemination and<br>implementation [8]. Since then, PBM programs have been implemented<br>in many countries around the world. In 2021, the WHO published a new<br>document to highlight the urgent need to close the gap in PBM aware-<br>ness and implementation and announced their upcoming initiative to<br>develop PBM implementation guidelines [42].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'104\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:22px\\'>At the European level, guidelines on bleeding management were<br>published in 2017 by the ESAIC [31] and PBM guidelines specifically</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'105\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>focussed on cardiac surgery were published in 2018 jointly by the<br>EACTS and the EACTA [1].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'106\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>Furthermore, the implementation of PBM programs has been<br>actively supported by the European Commission, in particular through<br>guides intended for national health authorities and hospitals, meant to<br>help EU member states make PBM a standard for improving the quality<br>and safety of patient care. [29,30]</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'107\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>However, while PBM practices are increasingly being used, national<br>guidelines are still rare and very few are specific to cardiac surgery. All<br>the current available guidelines follow and agree on the definition of<br>PBM as defined by the WHO [8], supported by three pillars: optimizing<br>blood volume, minimising blood loss and optimizing the patient\\'s<br>tolerance to anaemia.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'108\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>To decrease blood loss during cardiac surgery, European guidelines<br>mention that the assessment of specific haemostasis parameters in the<br>preoperative setting (such as fibrinogen level and platelet function for<br>specific patients...) could be useful to predict perioperative bleeding and<br>to decrease transfusion rates [1,43].</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'109\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>Anaemia is known to be a predictor of postoperative adverse out-<br>comes for patients, so its management is the cornerstone of PBM.<br>Limiting blood loss during surgical procedures is also of paramount<br>importance to reduce the use of blood products transfusions and limit<br>the risk for reoperation for bleeding. In this context, the European and<br>national PBM guidelines all recommend the prophylactic use of anti-<br>fibrinolytics to avoid or reduce perioperative bleeding. However, they<br>differ in the type of antifibrinolytic recommended, when it should be<br>given and how (bolus or infusion or both), including the dose (Table 3).<br>Most guidelines recommend only the use of tranexamic acid. Aprotinin<br>is rarely mentioned, partly because of its recent reintroduction in<br>Europe, and its continued non-availability on the market in some<br>countries such as Italy. How Aprotinin should be given and when, as well<br>as the dose and timing of administration are mostly not discussed<br>(Table 4). National PBM guidelines for European countries therefore<br>appear to be both few in number and heterogeneous. This situation<br>could partly explain the marked discrepancies found in a recent survey<br>of PBM practices in cardiac surgery across different European countries<br>[44]. In this survey, it appears that PBM programs are not universally or<br>consistently implemented in European cardiac surgical centres, resulting<br>in differences in patient\\'s management for the same clinical situation.<br>The survey highlights that, the differences observed in guidelines,<br>including antifibrinolytic use, exist between countries at an interna-<br>tional level and also at a national level with different protocols in in-<br>dividual cardiac surgical centres within a specific country, and<br>sometimes, different protocols within the same cardiac surgical centre.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'110\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>The situation is quite different in the United States and in Australia,<br>where PBM practices are more widely implemented. The American So-<br>ciety of Anesthesiologists (ASA) published its \"Practice guidelines for<br>perioperative blood management\" in 2015 giving general recommen-<br>dations for PBM [45]. However, although the use of antifibrinolytic<br>therapy is mentioned to reduce blood loss and risk of transfusion for<br>patient at high-risk of bleeding, or undergoing CPB, no detailed protocol<br>is provided. Furthermore, institutions such as the Society for the<br>Advancement of Blood Management (SABM) and the American Associ-<br>ation of Blood Banks (AABB)) actively promote the implementation of<br>PBM in the US by providing educational resources, partnerships and<br>certification to hospitals.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'111\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>Australia appears to be one of the countries with the most compre-<br>hensive \"supply\" ofPBM literature. The National Blood Authority (NBA)<br>administers a website dedicated to PBM, including extensive PBM<br>guidelines (Critical bleeding/massive transfusion; Perioperative; Medi-<br>cal; Critical care; Obstetrics and maternity; and Neonatal and paediat-<br>rics). These PBM guidelines were published in 2012, and in 2019 a<br>survey assessed how blood transfusions and patient outcomes in cardiac<br>surgery changed after the guidelines were published [46]. The authors<br>demonstrated that, thanks to the implementation of PBM guidelines,<br>there was a significant reduction in intraoperative blood transfusions in</p>\\n<footer id=\\'112\\' style=\\'font-size:16px\\'>7</footer>\\n<header id=\\'113\\' style=\\'font-size:14px\\'>A.

The NBA also provides a national PBM imple-<br>mentation strategy guide covering 2017-2021 (updated every 4 years),<br>as well as patient information documents. It defines the principle of PBM<br>and the objectives of the national strategy, including implementation of<br>nationally coordinated measures for PBM, decreasing discrepancies in<br>clinical practices, consolidating existing PBM programs, identifying gaps<br>in knowledge and patient care, and increasing awareness and under-<br>standing of PBM.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'116\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>All in all, European countries could benefit from the experience<br>gained through these programs developed by other countries to<br>improve, accelerate and deploy the implementation of PBM at a large<br>scale.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\'117\\' style=\\'font-size:16px\\'>5. Conclusion</h1>\\n<p id=\\'118\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>Despite the trend towards high-level PBM practices, currently very<br>few European countries have national PBM guidelines and these<br>guidelines, taken as a whole, are heterogeneous in form and content.<br>Antifibrinolytics play a major role in cardiac surgery, where the risk of<br>perioperative bleeding is high and affects a majority of patients, by<br>effectively reducing bleeding, transfusions and re-operations, as well as<br>their associated morbidity and mortality. They represent an essential<br>part of the pharmacological arsenal of patient blood management.<br>However, the use of these drugs in cardiac surgery in Europe is not<br>covered in sufficient detail by national recommendations. This lack of<br>common recommendations is partly due to the scarcity of available<br>robust data.

Introduction\\nCardiac surgery carries a high risk of peri-operative bleeding [1], as\\nevidenced by the high proportion (50-60%) of cardiac surgical patients\\nwho require allogeneic blood transfusion during and after surgery [2,3].\\nThe risk of bleeding in cardiac surgery is affected by numerous factors:\\ninvasiveness of the procedure; use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet\\nmedication; use of hypothermia; and use of cardiopulmonary bypass\\n(CPB) [1]. Several factors have been associated with an increased risk of\\nbleeding such as advanced age, poor platelet function, preoperative\\nanaemia, small body size, female sex, non-elective surgery, and repeat\\nsurgery [1].\\nPeri-operative bleeding has been shown to be an independent pre-\\ndictor of hospital mortality. In a study including more than 9000 pa-\\ntients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, massive blood loss (defined\\nby the transfusion of at least five units of packed red blood cells on the\\nday of surgery) was associated with an 8-fold increase in mortality [4].\\nOther studies have also reported excess morbidity, particularly in terms\\nof thromboembolic complications, infections and higher rates of surgical\\nre-exploration [5]. Notably, surgical re-exploration and transfusion\\nfollowing bleeding are also associated with increased infection, mor-\\ntality, and a longer stay in ICU and hospital [2,6]. Finally, excessive\\npostoperative haemorrhage in cardiac surgery has a significant eco-\\nnomic impact: a retrospective German analysis of more than 1100 pa-\\ntients estimated its average additional cost to be 66251 per patient [7].\\nThe concept of patient blood management (PBM), defined by the\\nWorld Health Organization as a \"patient-focused, evidence based and\\nsystematic approach for optimising the management of patients and\\ntransfusion of blood products to ensure high quality and effective patient\\ncare\" [8] includes an anaesthetic, pharmacological and surgical\\napproach. It is based on three pillars: optimization of blood mass,\\nminimization of blood loss and optimization of patient tolerance to\\nanaemia. In cardiac surgery, the use of antifibrinolytics is an essential\\ncomponent of the pharmacological approach in PBM and follows rec-\\nommendations from the European Association for Cardiothoracic Sur-\\ngery (EACTS) and the European Association of Cardiothoracic\\nAnaesthesiology (EACTA) [1].\\nThis review provides an overview of the major role of fibrinolysis in\\nhaemostatic disorders after cardiac surgery and how it influences their\\nmanagement, compares the current available guidelines in PBM and\\nanalyses the place of different antifibrinolytics in cardiac surgery in\\nEurope, according to these guidelines.\\n2. Fibrinolysis and heart surgery - antifibrinolytic treatments\\n2.1. Haemostatic disorders induced by cardiac surgery\\nCPB used during cardiac surgery leads to activation of the coagula-\\ntion system due to blood coming into contact with foreign surfaces such\\nas plastic [9,10]. Thus, by the end of CPB, a significant proportion of\\ncoagulation factors will have been consumed; fibrinogen levels are\\ndecreased by approximately 40% [9] and platelets are activated,\\nconsumed and show a selective loss of alpha granules. In contrast,\\nthrombin levels are elevated, which is not the case in other types of\\nsurgery [10]. Along with activating the generation of fibrin, thrombin is\\nalso an activator of fibrinolysis.\\nGenerally, fibrinolysis is a protective physiological response, pro-\\nportionately inhibiting excess clot formation. However, after massive\\ntrauma, surgery, or with the use of CPB, local regulation of this response\\nmay be overwhelmed, so that the systemic and simultaneous production\\nof thrombin and plasmin induces consumption coagulopathy, which\\nprevents the formation of a stable clot, resulting in bleeding [11,12].\\nFibrinolysis is also associated with impaired platelet function during and\\nafter CPB due to the action of plasmin and tissue plasminogen activator\\n(tPA) [11]. tPA is responsible for inhibition of platelet aggregation, and\\nhigh plasmin levels can cause damage to platelets through cleavage of\\nthe GPIb receptor and triggering their partial activation, thus inducing a\\nloss of responsiveness to further activation [13,14] (Fig. 1). Thus,\\nfibrinolysis plays a major role in the pathophysiology of haemorrhage\\nduring cardiac surgery, as evidenced by the strong correlation of fibri-\\nnolytic markers and the magnitude of blood loss after CPB [9,15].\\n2.2. Antifibrinolytic treatment\\nAntifibrinolytic drugs inhibit fibrinolysis and, when administered\\nprophylactically, help prevent peri-operative bleeding [16,17].\\nCommonly used antifibrinolytics include protease inhibitors (aprotinin)\\nand lysine analogues (tranexamic acid (TXA) and �-aminocaproic acid\\n(EACA)).\\nAprotinin is a potent inhibitor of free plasmin which has a limited\\neffect on physiological fibrinolysis [9,18]. Aprotinin is a broad-spectrum\\nprotease inhibitor, which also interacts with various other plasma pro-\\nteases such as trypsin, kallikrein and elastase. Among the anti-\\nfibrinolytics, it has the most potent activity [1,12]. It also has an anti-\\ninflammatory effect decreasing systemic inflammation after CPB [19].\\nLysine analogues are currently the most widely used anti-\\nfibrinolytics. These synthetic derivatives of lysine inhibit fibrinolysis by\\npreventing the formation of plasmin through their capacity to bind to\\nplasminogen at the lysine binding site, thus preventing its binding to\\nfibrin [11,18] (Fig. 2).\\nThe prophylactic administration of antifibrinolytics in surgery has\\nbeen widely researched and discussed. Antifibrinolytics reduce peri and\\npost-operative bleeding, transfusions, re-operations as well as\\nmorbidity, mortality, and associated costs, without increasing the inci-\\ndence of acute graft thrombosis or thromboembolism [20]. Data suggest\\nthat aprotinin has an advantage over lysine analogues in reducing peri-\\nand post-operative blood loss [21]. When trial results for the two lysine\\nanalogues were combined and compared with aprotinin alone, aprotinin\\nwas found to be slightly more effective in reducing the need for red\\nblood cell transfusion. The data from 150 trials performed in cardiac\\nsurgery in more than 17,000 patients are consistent with these results\\n[21] (Table 1).\\nIn 2008, aprotinin was withdrawn from the market following the\\npublication of observational studies that reported an increased risk of\\nadverse cardiological, neurological and renal events [9,22], as well as\\nthe preliminary results from a comparative, randomized, double-blind\\nstudy (the BART trial), which raised suspicion of excess mortality\\nlinked to aprotinin [23]. However, thereafter, numerous methodological\\nflaws were found in these analyses that could have influenced their re-\\nsults. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of data from 88 trials including over\\n15,000 patients found no increased risk of mortality associated with\\naprotinin compared with other antifibrinolytics [24]. In 2012, after re-\\nevaluation of the data, the European Medicines Agency (EMA)\\nconcluded that: \"the data from the BART study concerning excess\\nmortality associated with aprotinin were not reliable\" and lifted the\\nsuspension of aprotinin\\'s marketing authorization, but restricted its\\nindication to the prophylactic use in adult patients at high risk of major\\nbleeding undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) sur-\\ngery [25].\\nFor the lysine analogues, attention has recently been drawn to the\\npossible but rare occurrence of epileptic seizures [9]. A large retro-\\nspective study of over 11,000 patients undergoing CPB reported an\\nincidence of seizures of 0.9% in those treated with TXA. Patients with\\nepileptic seizures had a 2.5 to 3-fold higher death rate, and hospital stay\\nwas twice as long. The administration of TXA has been shown to be an\\nindependent predictor of seizures, correlated with higher doses [26,27].\\n3.

Klein et al.\\nJournal of Clinical Anesthesia 78 (2022) 110654\\n3.1. Methodology for the overview of PBM guidelines in Europe\\nA literature search was performed in December 2020 and repeated in\\nJanuary 2021 using PubMed, Cochrane Database and Google Scholar\\ndatabases. Twelve documents were identified containing or related to\\nPBM guidelines. Of these 13 articles, 8 were actual PBM guidelines\\n(Table 2).\\n3.2. European guidelines\\nThe European Commission promotes the implementation of PBM\\nprograms, by supporting the \"Optimal Blood Use Project\" which led to\\nthe creation of a website and to publication in 2016 of the \"Manual of\\nOptimal Blood Use\" [28]. The use of antifibrinolytics is mentioned to\\navoid the need for transfusion during elective surgery, notably TXA for\\npatients with high risk of bleeding. The following year, the European\\nCommission published a guide for building national PBM programs for\\nhealth authorities and for hospitals inside the EU [29,30]. This guide\\ndefines the basics of PBM, presents some successful non-European PBM\\ninitiatives and identifies current gaps and limiting factors in the\\nimplementation of PBM at a large scale (lack of PBM awareness, lack of\\nundergraduate education on PBM and transfusion in nursing and med-\\nical schools, lack of coordinated patient care, etc.). This guide is to be\\nused as a tool setting the framework for national authorities to support\\nthe implementation and dissemination of PBM programs across Europe.\\nAt the European level, an update of the \"Management of severe\\nperioperative bleeding\" guidelines was published in 2017 by the ESAIC\\n[31]. These general PBM recommendations are not focused on cardiac\\nsurgery; nevertheless, the management of cardiac surgical patients is\\ndiscussed. The recommendations are classified according to the GRADE\\n(Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evalua-\\ntion) system. In cardiovascular surgery, the authors recommend the\\nprophylactic administration of TXA before CPB in patients undergoing\\nCABG (level of evidence (LoE) 1A). Besides, topical application of TXA\\nto the chest cavity in order to reduce blood loss following cardiac sur-\\ngery is also suggested (LoE 2C). Aprotinin is mentioned throughout the\\ndocument, with comparison of the efficacy data from several clinical\\ntrials. No detailed protocol or dosing regimens for the use of anti-\\nfibrinolytics (either TXA or aprotinin) is provided in these guidelines\\nand the indications for the use of aprotinin are not defined.\\nEuropean PBM guidelines specifically dedicated to cardiac surgery\\nwere published jointly in 2018 by the EACTS and the EACTA [1]. The\\nrecommendations are divided according to the three steps of the surgical\\nprocedure: preoperative management, intraoperative management, and\\npostoperative management. During the preoperative phase, the authors\\nsuggest a potential interest for point-of-care (POC) testing, which is\\nmeant to predict perioperative bleeding. Thus, a preoperative assess-\\nment of some specific haemostasis parameters has been proposed\\n(standard laboratory testing, viscoelastic testing and/or platelet func-\\ntion evaluation). The recommendations are as follow: 1/ preoperative\\nlevels of fibrinogen may be considered to identify patients at high-risk of\\nbleeding (Class IIb - level C), and 2/ platelet function testing may be\\nconsidered only in patients who recently received P2Y12 inhibitors or\\nwho have ongoing dual antiplatelet therapy, to guide the decision on the\\ntiming of cardiac surgery (Class IIb - Level B). In the perioperative\\nsetting, treatment algorithms based on viscoelastic POC tests should be\\nconsidered in order to reduce the number of transfusions for the\\nbleeding patient (Class IIa - Level B).\\nAntifibrinolytics (TXA, aprotinin or EACA) are recommended during\\nthe intraoperative period to reduce blood loss and the need for trans-\\nfusion, and also to reduce the risk of reoperation for bleeding (TXA and\\naprotinin) (level of evidence 1A). No therapeutic protocols or dosing\\nregimens for the use of antifibrinolytics are recommended. Finally, the\\nimplementation of a PBM protocol for bleeding patients is recommended\\n(LoE1C).\\n3.3. National guidelines\\n3.3.1. France\\nSpecific guidelines dedicated to PBM are currently not available in\\nFrance, however, a White Paper was published in 2018 [32] by several\\nlearned societies (French Society of Anaesthesia and Resuscitation;\\nStudy Group on Haemostasis and Thrombosis; French Society of\\nThoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery; French Society of Vigilance and\\nTherapeutics).\\nThis publication summarizes the principles of PBM with the three-\\npillars-based approach and presents a series of recommendations for\\nthe implementation of PBM in France. It includes an international\\nliterature review, a multidisciplinary field survey and recommendations\\nfrom the scientific committee to provide guidance on the implementa-\\ntion of PBM programs. The field survey demonstrated that PBM as a\\nformalized concept was not very well known by French practitioners.\\nRegarding the use of antifibrinolytics, the authors recommended TXA (1\\ng) at anaesthetic induction and at the end of the surgical procedure (1 g).\\nThe authors considered that the topical application of TXA needs further\\nresearch. It should serve as a basis for French guidelines on PBM, which\\nare expected soon by the Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS) [33].\\n3.3.2. Germany\\nIn 2020, cross-sectional guidelines on therapy with blood compo-\\nnents and plasma derivatives were published by the Executive board of\\nthe German Medical Association [34]. Cardiac surgery is mentioned\\nthroughout the document, but without any discussion on the potential\\nuse of antifibrinolytics. However, the use of TXA is recommended to\\nlimit blood loss in several types of surgical procedures and for the peri-\\nand postpartum period.\\n3.3.3. Italy\\nThe Italian Society of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and\\nIntensive Care has written a position paper on the clinical standards for\\nPBM, and perioperative haemostasis and coagulation management in\\n2019 [35]. These recommendations are divided according to the three\\nsteps of any surgical procedure (pre-, peri- and postoperative period),\\neach one being subdivided according to the three pillars of PBM\\napproach. Cardiac surgery is discussed throughout the document. The\\nuse of antifibrinolytics is discussed in the \"Pillar 2 - Blood containment\"\\nsection of the chapter on perioperative management. No detailed\\nguidelines are provided, but prophylactic administration of TXA is rec-\\nommended before CPB in patients undergoing CABG, as advised in the\\nESAIC guidelines [31]. Finally, the authors mentioned that to decrease\\nthe risk of postoperative blood loss following cardiac surgery, TXA can\\nbe applied topically.\\n3.3.4. The Netherlands\\nGuidelines on blood transfusion have been published in 2011 by the\\nDutch Institute For Healthcare Improvement [36]. They are not dedi-\\ncated to PBM, which is not surprising as this concept was just emerging\\nat that time. However, these guidelines include \"Blood saving tech-\\nniques and medications,\" which covers the following points: techniques\\nto limit blood loss during surgical procedures; preoperative and peri-\\noperative autologous blood transfusion techniques; and combination of\\nblood saving techniques. Cardiac surgery and the use of antifibrinolytics\\nare discussed through the document. Aprotinin and TXA are mentioned.\\nHowever, at the time of publication, aprotinin had been withdrawn from\\nthe market, thus its use is not recommended. TXA is described as a safe\\nand effective drug to reduce blood loss and transfusion in cardiac sur-\\ngery (evidence Level 1A1).\\n3.3.5.

The United Kingdom\\nThe UK has several guidelines, each dealing with a particular aspect\\nof PBM. A short document entitled \"Patient blood management an\\nevidence-based approach to patient care, published in 2014 by the\\nNational Blood Transfusion Committee (NBTC) and the NHS (National\\nHealth Service) [38] provides recommendations for the implementation\\nof PBM, but not specific to cardiac surgery. TXA is cited as a pharma-\\ncological drug to be used to reduce blood loss in intraoperative man-\\nagement, and in case of major bleeding. Nevertheless, no specific\\nprotocol on the use of TXA is proposed or discussed. The British Com-\\nmittee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) published two different\\nguidelines in 2015, under the GRADE rating system. The first covers the\\nidentification and management of preoperative anaemia [39], and the\\nsecond covers haematological management of major bleeding [40] and\\nprovides an overview of the organisational principles, transfusion of\\ndifferent blood products, pharmacological agents and addresses\\ndifferent specific situations. TXA and aprotinin are discussed, but only\\nthe use ofTXA is recommended in case of major bleeding after injury, 1 g\\nintravenously over 10 min, followed by a maintenance administration of\\n1 g over 8 h (LoE1A). In non-traumatic major haemorrhage, the use of\\nTXA should be considered but not aprotinin (LoE1B). Regarding the\\nprevention of bleeding in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery,\\nthe authors recommended initial administration of TXA (10 mg.kg-1)\\nfollowed by 1 mg.kg 1 h -1 bleeding (LoE1B). Finally,\\nto prevent\\nguidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and\\nIreland (AAGBI) were published in 2016, which address the use of blood\\nproducts and their alternatives [41]. They are not focused on cardiac\\nsurgery but devote a chapter specifically to it. PBM measures are rec-\\nommended in patients who are at high risk of bleeding, and TXA and\\naprotinin are mentioned. TXA is recommended to be used as a 1 g bolus,\\nwith an additional infusion of 500 mg.h 1 that could be considered.\\nAprotinin is recommended in case of myocardial revascularisation, as\\nlicensed.\\n4. Discussion\\nIn March 2011, the WHO held a \"Global Forum on Blood Safety:\\nPatient Blood Management\" aimed at establishing a framework for the\\nWHO Member States to actively support PBM dissemination and\\nimplementation [8]. Since then, PBM programs have been implemented\\nin many countries around the world. In 2021, the WHO published a new\\ndocument to highlight the urgent need to close the gap in PBM aware-\\nness and implementation and announced their upcoming initiative to\\ndevelop PBM implementation guidelines [42].\\nAt the European level, guidelines on bleeding management were\\npublished in 2017 by the ESAIC [31] and PBM guidelines specifically\\nfocussed on cardiac surgery were published in 2018 jointly by the\\nEACTS and the EACTA [1].\\nFurthermore, the implementation of PBM programs has been\\nactively supported by the European Commission, in particular through\\nguides intended for national health authorities and hospitals, meant to\\nhelp EU member states make PBM a standard for improving the quality\\nand safety of patient care. [29,30]\\nHowever, while PBM practices are increasingly being used, national\\nguidelines are still rare and very few are specific to cardiac surgery. All\\nthe current available guidelines follow and agree on the definition of\\nPBM as defined by the WHO [8], supported by three pillars: optimizing\\nblood volume, minimising blood loss and optimizing the patient\\'s\\ntolerance to anaemia.\\nTo decrease blood loss during cardiac surgery, European guidelines\\nmention that the assessment of specific haemostasis parameters in the\\npreoperative setting (such as fibrinogen level and platelet function for\\nspecific patients...) could be useful to predict perioperative bleeding and\\nto decrease transfusion rates [1,43].\\nAnaemia is known to be a predictor of postoperative adverse out-\\ncomes for patients, so its management is the cornerstone of PBM.\\nLimiting blood loss during surgical procedures is also of paramount\\nimportance to reduce the use of blood products transfusions and limit\\nthe risk for reoperation for bleeding. In this context, the European and\\nnational PBM guidelines all recommend the prophylactic use of anti-\\nfibrinolytics to avoid or reduce perioperative bleeding. However, they\\ndiffer in the type of antifibrinolytic recommended, when it should be\\ngiven and how (bolus or infusion or both), including the dose (Table 3).\\nMost guidelines recommend only the use of tranexamic acid. Aprotinin\\nis rarely mentioned, partly because of its recent reintroduction in\\nEurope, and its continued non-availability on the market in some\\ncountries such as Italy. How Aprotinin should be given and when, as well\\nas the dose and timing of administration are mostly not discussed\\n(Table 4). National PBM guidelines for European countries therefore\\nappear to be both few in number and heterogeneous. This situation\\ncould partly explain the marked discrepancies found in a recent survey\\nof PBM practices in cardiac surgery across different European countries\\n[44]. In this survey, it appears that PBM programs are not universally or\\nconsistently implemented in European cardiac surgical centres, resulting\\nin differences in patient\\'s management for the same clinical situation.\\nThe survey highlights that, the differences observed in guidelines,\\nincluding antifibrinolytic use, exist between countries at an interna-\\ntional level and also at a national level with different protocols in in-\\ndividual cardiac surgical centres within a specific country, and\\nsometimes, different protocols within the same cardiac surgical centre.\\nThe situation is quite different in the United States and in Australia,\\nwhere PBM practices are more widely implemented. The American So-\\nciety of Anesthesiologists (ASA) published its \"Practice guidelines for\\nperioperative blood management\" in 2015 giving general recommen-\\ndations for PBM [45]. However, although the use of antifibrinolytic\\ntherapy is mentioned to reduce blood loss and risk of transfusion for\\npatient at high-risk of bleeding, or undergoing CPB, no detailed protocol\\nis provided. Furthermore, institutions such as the Society for the\\nAdvancement of Blood Management (SABM) and the American Associ-\\nation of Blood Banks (AABB)) actively promote the implementation of\\nPBM in the US by providing educational resources, partnerships and\\ncertification to hospitals.\\nAustralia appears to be one of the countries with the most compre-\\nhensive \"supply\" ofPBM literature. The National Blood Authority (NBA)\\nadministers a website dedicated to PBM, including extensive PBM\\nguidelines (Critical bleeding/massive transfusion; Perioperative; Medi-\\ncal; Critical care; Obstetrics and maternity; and Neonatal and paediat-\\nrics). These PBM guidelines were published in 2012, and in 2019 a\\nsurvey assessed how blood transfusions and patient outcomes in cardiac\\nsurgery changed after the guidelines were published [46]. The authors\\ndemonstrated that, thanks to the implementation of PBM guidelines,\\nthere was a significant reduction in intraoperative blood transfusions in\\n7\\nA. Klein et al.\\nJournal of Clinical Anesthesia 78 (2022) 110654\\npatients undergoing cardiac surgery, and an associated reduction in\\nhospital length of stay. The NBA also provides a national PBM imple-\\nmentation strategy guide covering 2017-2021 (updated every 4 years),\\nas well as patient information documents. It defines the principle of PBM\\nand the objectives of the national strategy, including implementation of\\nnationally coordinated measures for PBM, decreasing discrepancies in\\nclinical practices, consolidating existing PBM programs, identifying gaps\\nin knowledge and patient care, and increasing awareness and under-\\nstanding of PBM.\\nAll in all, European countries could benefit from the experience\\ngained through these programs developed by other countries to\\nimprove, accelerate and deploy the implementation of PBM at a large\\nscale.\\n5. Conclusion\\nDespite the trend towards high-level PBM practices, currently very\\nfew European countries have national PBM guidelines and these\\nguidelines, taken as a whole, are heterogeneous in form and content.\\nAntifibrinolytics play a major role in cardiac surgery, where the risk of\\nperioperative bleeding is high and affects a majority of patients, by\\neffectively reducing bleeding, transfusions and re-operations, as well as\\ntheir associated morbidity and mortality. They represent an essential\\npart of the pharmacological arsenal of patient blood management.\\nHowever, the use of these drugs in cardiac surgery in Europe is not\\ncovered in sufficient detail by national recommendations. This lack of\\ncommon recommendations is partly due to the scarcity of available\\nrobust data. It would be of particular interest to set up comparative\\nclinical studies with the major antifibrinolytics to determine the best\\nprotocols and dosages to use in practice and thus to homogenize prac-\\ntice. To complement these trials, a network meta-analysis or a system-\\natic review of the evidence to date on antifibrinolytics in cardiac surgery\\nand their effects on major patients\\' outcomes might be useful to generate\\nimportant data to rely on for daily practices.\\nTo conclude, implementation of PBM programs in Europe is chal-\\nlenging, as there is a real need for homogenous guidance in PBM and the\\nuse of antifibrinolytics, especially in cardiac surgery.\\nFinancial support and sponsorship\\nThis work was supported by Nordic Pharma, for the institutional\\nsupport, and Public Health Expertise for the medical writing support.\\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\\nAK has received funding for research to his institution or honoraria\\nfrom Massimo, Fisher & Paykel, Pharmacosmos and Nordic Pharma.
