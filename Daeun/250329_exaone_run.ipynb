In this joint European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) and British Journal of Anaesthesia (BJA) guideline on airway manage- ment in neonates and infants, we present aggregated and evidence-based recommendations to assist clinicians in providing safe and effective medical care. We identiﬁed seven main areas of interest for airway management: i) preoperative assessment and preparation; ii) medications; iii) techniques and algorithms; iv) identiﬁcation and treatment of difﬁcult airways; v) conﬁrmation of tracheal intubation; vi) tracheal extubation, and vii) human factors. Based on these areas, Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes (PICO) questions were derived that guided a structured literature search. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology was used to formulate the recommendations based on those studies included with consideration of their methodological quality (strong ‘1’ or weak ‘2’ recommendation with high ‘A’, medium ‘B’ or low ‘C’ quality of evidence). In summary, we recommend: 1. Use medical history and physical examination to predict difﬁcult airway management (1E). 2.'),\n",

Airway management is required for anaesthetised patients undergoing surgical or diagnostic procedures and is essential for life-threatening conditions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and critical care. Several guidelines have been published to standardise airway management and tracheal intubation procedures for rou- tine and emergency situations in patients with normal, known, or anticipated difﬁcult airway.1–4 However, there are no speciﬁc guidelines for neonates and infants. Children have a unique anatomy and physiology that can present clinicians with signiﬁcant challenges.5 Younger children, term neonates, and pre-term neonates are at the highest risk for respiratory and traumatic complications from airway management. Most devices available for airway management are not speciﬁcally designed or test- ed for use in children.3,6–8 This practice guideline aims to provide an evidence-based approach to airway management in neonates and infants. It was developed by a core group of experts in paediatric airway management, with the intention to serve anaesthe- tists working in a variety of paediatric settings, from highly specialised to district centres.'),\n",

As expertise and resources differ across centres, these practice guidelines are not a standard of care, however, they should serve as a basis for developing local institutionally approved operating proce- dures and best practice guidelines. In 2021, 23 internationally recognised experts in airway management formed a task force aimed at writing updated practice guidelines for airway management in neonates and infants. The proposal was submitted to the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) and to the Editorial Board of the British Journal of Anaes- thesia (BJA) for logistic support and endorsement. A joint endeavour between ESAIC and BJA was approved. Clinical queries were developed in the form of seven Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) groups and further developed into ﬁve elements for the search strategy. The complete list of PICO groups was then revised and approved by the task force, and gener- ated the following research questions: 1.

Panel members were also encouraged to add any missing papers of interest that they were aware of, and to conduct related searches themselves. The resulting titles were screened by two independent authors. A third author was assigned to resolve conﬂicts for inclusion or exclusion. After removing duplicates, the authors screened titles with abstracts in a two-stage procedure.'),\n",

Recommendation: We recommend use of an adequate level of sedation or general anaesthesia in neonates and infants during airway management to ensure patient comfort and safety (1B). Recommendation: We recommend use of neuromuscular block before tracheal intubation when maintaining spon- taneous breathing is not necessary (1C). The risks and beneﬁts of neuromuscular blocking agent administration should be balanced for the individual patient and team skills.

In conventional direct laryn- goscopy, a good view of the glottis is usually associated with easy intubation. This might not be the case when performing indirect video-laryngoscopy, particularly when using a hyperangulated blade.74–77 Because video- laryngoscopy provides a full view of the glottis without aligning the oral and the tracheal axis, passage of a tracheal tube can be more difﬁcult. This is particularly true if a hyperangulated blade is used, resulting in greater misalignment of the oral and tracheal axes and a longer and more angulated route for the tracheal tube to pass into the trachea. This makes use of a stylet mandatory when a hyperangulated videolaryngoscope is used. This can result in more time needed for tracheal intubation and lower overall success rates, especially in small'),\n",

Strategies for tracheal extubation What is the best strategy for safe extubation in neonates and infants after difﬁcult intubation, either anticipated or unanticipated? Suggestion: We suggest assessing clinical signs like con- jugate gaze, facial grimace, eye-opening and purposeful movements to predict successful awake extubation. If measurable, a tidal volume >5 ml kg(cid:3)1 can support readiness to extubate (2C). Clinical practice statement: Equipment for reintubation should be immediately available at every tracheal extu- bation, especially in cases of difﬁcult tracheal intubation or previous failed extubation. The speciﬁc airway pathol- ogy, anatomical reason for difﬁcult intubation (i.e. airway swelling), and number of intubation attempts should be considered. Evidence summary: Whereas the literature is scarce re- garding tracheal extubation in infants with difﬁcult air- way, studies have identiﬁed predictors for successful extubation in infants without difﬁcult airways after general anaesthesia.'),\n",

Evidence summary: Early removal of supraglottic airway devices in children under general anaesthesia is often advocated to reduce the risk of laryngospasm, coughing, airway obstruction/activation, desaturation, or haemody- namic instability, and to increase operating room turnover and efﬁciency. However, the literature often fails to distinguish between deep and awake extubation (Sup- plementary Table S21, http://links.lww.com/EJA/A891). A Cochrane systematic review assessed 15 RCTs of which 10 were exclusively in children and one included adults and children.135 All trials had a mixed population of children ranging from infants to 18 yr old and used the LMA Classicj for elective general anaesthesia. There was insufﬁcient evidence in favour of or against early or late removal of a supraglottic airway device to reduce the risk of laryngospasm and desaturation.'),\n",

Clinical practice statement: Addressing human factors- related errors and improving communication and team- work might reduce patient harm. Similar to other complex systems with frequent human- human and human-machine interactions, adverse events in anaesthesia usually occur as a result of unpredictable combinations of human and organisational failures.139 Several human factor components are critical for anaes- thesia safety including teamwork, communication, situa- tional awareness, human error, cultural factors, and hierarchy.140–143 Cognitive processes in decision making and cognitive factors such as overconﬁdence, ﬁxation errors, and loss aversion play a crucial role in decision- making in the fast-moving and complex anaesthesia environment.144 For example, ﬁxation errors such as focussing on tracheal intubation rather than oxygenation can contribute to anaesthesia-related morbidity and mor- tal-ity.145 Clinicians may fear a loss of reputation and perseverate on a failing technique instead of calling for help (loss aversion).'),\n",

This is highlighted by studies involving paediatricians who report their last intubation occurring more than 1 year ago.158 Simulation-based training for neonatal tra- cheal intubation is not comparable to adult simulation training. Neonatal mannequins have low ﬁdelity and often do not adequately replicate the neonatal and infant airway. Because of often limited reproduction of anatom- ical conditions, differences in consistency of artiﬁcial tissues, and lack of natural secretions and slipperiness, training with neonatal mannequins does not fully prepare trainees for neonatal intubation.'),\n",

This expert opinion was supported by a questionnaire by participants of manne- quin based neonatal tracheal intubation training.159 At least familiarity with the devices and algorithms and team performance can be improved by simulation training. For training of neonatal and infant intubation in the real world, videolaryngoscopes with standard blades (Macin- tosh or Miller) should be used to provide a team view of the procedure and enable continuous supervision and teaching.160–162 The equipment necessary for safe airway management should be used regularly by those who manage difﬁcult neonatal airways. These practice guidelines were developed by an inter- national task force on behalf of the ESAIC and BJA with the aim of providing evidence-based recommendations. The task force decided to limit the guidelines to the neonatal and infant population (up to 1 yr of age) because these patients have been identiﬁed as the most vulnera- ble during airway management. They experience a higher risk of complications such as hypoxaemia, cardiac arrest, airway trauma, and neurologic injury during airway management than older children.'),\n",

The task force recommends a careful physical examination to identify patients at risk of difﬁcult airway management. Medical history and physical assessment represent the best ways to predict a difﬁcult airway and plan airway manage- ment. Use of videolaryngoscopy in this patient population is strongly recommended. Most recent evidence on neonatal and infant airway management demonstrates the beneﬁt of vid-eolaryngoscopy in reducing the number of attempts at tracheal intubation and increasing ﬁrst-pass tracheal intubation success compared with direct laryngoscopy. However, direct laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopy are not mutually exclusive techniques. With standard blade videolaryngoscopes, it is possible to perform both direct laryngoscopy and indirect videolar- yngoscopy simultaneously. One of the difﬁculties in inter- preting the evidence before the task force was the lack of clarity over the role of indirect laryngoscopy (where only the video screen is used) and video-assisted direct laryn- goscopy where a video-enabled laryngoscope is used to perform direct laryngoscopy.'),\n",

However, the task force emphasises the im- portance of teaching the correct use and potential pitfalls of videolaryngoscopy in order to minimise harm to children with the transition to use of video-laryngoscopy, which will probably replace traditional direct laryngoscopes in the near future. Although the role of videoassisted direct laryngoscopy remains unclear, it is a technique that nicely straddles the two techniques and should be an important focus during paediatric airway training. The guidelines highlight the importance of oxygenation during the tracheal intubation process. Oxygen adminis- tration during airway instrumentation can increase the safe apnoea time and improve the chance of successful tracheal intubation.

The task force agreed to limit the number of tracheal intubation attempts to four (one by a physician in training and three by a senior anaesthesiologist) and to consider waking the patient if the airway cannot be secured.

However, limited evidence often results in inadequate pain control after cleft palate surgery. Objectives The aim of this review was to evaluate the available evidence and to develop recommendations for optimal pain management after cleft palate surgery using procedure- specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology. Adequate pain relief is key for successful surgical correction of cleft palate. Agitated and crying children are more likely to experience wound dehiscence and develop fistulas. Hence, adequate postoperative pain relief should improve surgical outcomes including a decrease in postoperative opioid consumption, time to first postoperative feeding, and length of hospital stay.5 However, post- operative pain is often inadequately treated because it is difficult to assess in the pediatric cohort. Also, the evidence pertaining to appropriate postopera- tive analgesia is sparse, and specific recommenda- tions are lacking. We hypothesized that multimodal perioperative analgesia impacts postoperative pain in cleft palate surgery patients.'),\n",

We hypothesized that multimodal perioperative analgesia impacts postoperative pain in cleft palate surgery patients. Evidence review MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews assessing pain in children undergoing cleft palate repair published in English language from July 2002, through August 2023. Findings Of 1048 identified studies, 19 randomized controlled trials and 4 systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Interventions that improved postoperative pain, and are recommended, include suprazygomatic maxillary nerve block or palatal nerve block (if maxillary nerve block cannot be performed). Addition of dexmedetomidine to local anesthetic for suprazygomatic maxillary nerve block or, alternatively, as intravenous administration perioperatively is recommended. These interventions should be combined with a basic analgesic regimen including acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs. Of note, pre- incisional local anesthetic infiltration and dexamethasone were administered as a routine in several studies, however, because of limited procedure- specific evidence their contribution to pain relief after cleft palate surgery remains unknown.'),\n",

To develop evidence- based procedure- specific pain management recommendations, a collabora- tion of anesthetists and surgeons has established a Working Group–PROcedure- SPECific postop- erative pain managemenT (PROSPECT).6 7 The recommendations are made based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, and meta- analyses. The methodology includes a Delphi process that takes clinical practice, efficacy, and adverse effects of each potential analgesic technique into consideration.6 Conclusion The present review identified an evidence- based analgesic regimen for cleft palate surgery in pediatric patients. This systematic review aims to assess the available literature on the effects of analgesics and anesthetics on pain after surgical correction of congenital cleft palate. Secondary outcomes, including rescue anal- gesics, the time to recovery, and adverse effects, were addressed when reported, and the limita- tions of the data were reviewed. The intent was to develop evidence- based recommendations for management of pain accompanying surgical correc- tion of congenital cleft palates. PROSPERO registration number CRD42022364788.'),\n",

INTRODUCTION With reported incidences of 1 to 25 in 10 000 live births, cleft palate is among the most frequent congenital birth defects.1 2 The focus of cleft palate surgery is to improve functional impairments such as speech, hearing, and dentition.3 Furthermore, a significant improvement in the psychosocial devel- opment of the treated children can be achieved.4 The search and review strategy were followed as defined by the PROSPECT methods.6 The study was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022364788).'),\n",

Instead, a visualization of the more superficially situated infratemporal fossa and local anesthetic spread within this region are described. At present, there are no studies comparing landmark- based with ultrasound- guided suprazygomatic maxillary nerve blocks. Therefore, no specific recommendation on needle guidance can be given. Although palatal blocks give a similar reduction in pain intensity, a higher postoperative opioid consumption was found compared with maxillary nerve blocks in one study.13 Therefore, we recommend palatal nerve blocks when suprazygomatic nerve blocks cannot be performed.'),\n",

Our recom- mendation corresponds to the conclusions of a systematic review by Oberhofer and colleagues21 who identify suprazygomatic maxillary nerve blocks as the preferred method for reducing pain in cleft palate surgery. In contrast, Morzycki et al19 conclude that palatal nerve blocks demonstrate the greatest effectiveness in palatal repair, based on an their systematic review, but it included both randomized- and non- randomized controlled studies. Dexmedetomidine might be used either as an adjuvant for maxil- lary nerve block or as perioperative intravenous systemic application.

High dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations can cause pronounced side effects including dizziness, bradycardia, or hypotension.42 The same concern applies for the simultaneous use of dexmedetomidine or other alpha- 2 agonists for premedication. Although there was limited procedure- specific evidence, two interventions were administered in most included studies and may have contributed to pain control. A local anesthetic combined with a vasoconstrictive drug is routinely infiltrated before surgery to reduce perioperative bleeding.43 Also, local wound infiltration is a key component of multimodal analgesia in numerous surgical procedures.44 However, the analgesic effects of local anesthetic infil- tration for cleft palate repair are only supported by one study.29 Simi- larly, dexamethasone that was used intraoperatively in some of the studies, most likely for antiemetic prophylaxis, could have provided some analgesia.'),\n",

However, country- specific medical practices might make certain strategies for postoperative analgesia difficult to transpose to other regions in the world. Third, in recent years there are increasing concerns that the country of study origin and the publications in predatory journals might influence the strength of evidence.52 However, the included studies had minimal risk of bias and overall quality is deemed good by the PROSPECT group.

As a result, 8 of the 97 studies assessed for eligi- bility were excluded from the review. Even though the number of excluded studies is low, language restriction is a limitation of our review that could have led to language bias.53 Finally, in several studies basic analgesic techniques were not included or only acetaminophen was administered to the patients. Ideally, basic analgesia should have included a combination of acetaminophen with NSAIDs or COX- 2- specific inhibitors.44 In patients receiving a comprehensive basic analgesia treatment, the effects of analgesic interventions, for example, nerve block and additives, might be smaller or even insignificant. According to the PROSPECT methodology, recommended interventions must add a clinically relevant analgesic effect when added to a basic analgesic regimen.6 In summary, as cleft palate surgery has to occur in early childhood, appropriate analgesia is key to avoid wound dehiscence following agitation. Evidence- based analgesic efficacy and risks of each anal- gesic technique were considered to determine the PROSPECT recommendations (box 1).

The lack of precise monitoring equipment forced anesthesia providers in the recent past to generously provide their patients with oxygen. The paradigm was that an overload of oxy- gen was not harmful or at least less harmful. Currently, more is known about the advantages and disadvantages of oxygen [2–5]. In modern perioperative care, high levels of oxygen are still used during preoxygenation to minimize the risk of hypoxia during airway management [6]. There is also weak evidence that perioperative hyperoxygenation can protect patients against postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) [7]. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggested in 2018 to administer a FiO2 of 80% to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). This suggestion concerns perioperative care for adults and has been challenged. No suggestions were made for pediatric care [8]. However, oxygen can have a direct toxic effect.

However, oxygen can have a direct toxic effect. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be generated during oxygen processing at the cellular level. They have a small positive role in the immune system but have mostly a negative contribution to human tissues [9]. First, they can lead to DNA damage via oxidation of cell structures. Second, protein function can be affected. Third, they will damage pulmonary tissue which can lead to acute lung injury [10,11]. These effects are particularly seen in neonates [12]. Besides these direct toxic effects, oxygen has systemic effects as well. It can lead to absorption atelectasis and systemic vaso- constriction, it influences hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, ROS could influence myocardial function after myocardial infarction, and oxygen could reduce cerebral blood flow [2,13]. In intensive care and emergency settings protocols have been implemented to limit the use of oxygen, for example, during trauma care and resuscitation care [14,15]. Especially in premature infants, a well- defined range of SpO2 targets is recommended to reduce the detri- mental effects of oxygen, with a particular emphasis on preventing the onset of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [10,16–18].'),\n",

This is a goal-directed strategy of oxygen administration, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been sub- ject of research in pediatric anesthesia. Besides, no formal recommen- dations exist for oxygen use during pediatric anesthesia. The Safetots initiative promotes the safe conduct of anesthesia to every child, which includes the suggestion to maintain normoxemia [19]. Pediatric anes- thesiologists may therefore find themselves in a dilemma. On the one hand, they are familiar with the above mentioned negative effects of oxygen. On the other hand, due to higher oxygen demand in children, combined with a lower functional residual capacity of the lungs, desa- turation and hypoxemia may occur more easily during pediatric anesthesia. In adult patients, oxygen management during anesthesia was investigated earlier [20]. Because data of oxygen management in pedi- atric anesthesia are scarce, the goal of this study is to investigate the intraoperative administration of oxygen and the incidence of hyper- oxemia in our current practice. 2.

Currently there is no clear definition of hyperoxemia, and cut-off values are a matter of debate. [3,5] As normoxemia could be defined as PaO2 7 to 13.3 kPa (50 to 100 mmHg), the authors have chosen pragmatically to define the values below and above these physiological range as hypoxemia and hyperoxemia, respectively. [22–24] Therefore, hyperoxemia was defined as values above a cut-off point of 13.3 kPa (equivalent to 100 mmHg) and severe hyperoxemia as values above a cut-off of 26.6 kPa (equivalent to 200 mmHg). 2.4.

One expla- nation for this phenomenon could be the multidisciplinary approach for diagnostic or surgical procedures in (premature) neonates. Since the implementation of the ‘Dutch Recommendations in Perioperative Care for Neonates’ in 2018, this is the standard of care for every high-risk operation on neonates in The Netherlands [29]. Preoperatively, all involved health care workers (anesthesiologists, neonatologists, pedia- tricians, surgeons) discuss every single case and define intraoperative targets (i.e. PaO2, SpO2, electrolytes, hemoglobin). Also, international guidelines exist for the use of oxygen in neonatal intensive care units. A target range is determined for every patient and oxygen is precisely titrated. Progress could be made in the nearby future in other subgroups as well in titrating inspiratory oxygen based on SpO2 values. The median SpO2 was 99% (IQR 98 to 100%); therefore, comparable cut-off values should be possible to implement in these other subgroups.'),\n",

In addition, upon reaching a SaO2 of 100%, the corresponding PaO2 was already above 13.3 kPa; 100 mmHg. This suggests that patients maintaining a saturation level of 99–100% are consistently in a state of hyper- oxygenation, leading to the argument that oxygen should be adjusted accordingly. It is known that pulse oximetry is relatively good at detecting hypoxemia. However, an overload of oxygen, with SpO2 values above 98–99%, is not detectable with pulse oximetry alone. The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve shows the relation between the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin and the partial pressure of O2. Although the partial pressure can continue to rise, the oxygen saturation obviously cannot exceed 100%. The oxygen reserve index (ORI) is a supplemental parameter that could provide insight into this moderate hyperoxic range (13,3 - 26,6; 100–200 mmHg). Various recent studies have described its use, also during pediatric anesthesia [30–32]. The ORI could be useful during airway management, when high levels of oxygen are being used, to warn anesthesiologists when oxygen levels start to drop.'),\n",

There is no universally applicable solution when it comes to oxygen supply. Factors such as age, comor- bidities and ASA classification will serve as guiding parameters for the anesthesiologist in the titration of oxygen. Our results are slightly more conservative than those Morkane et al. found in a British adult population [20]. In a prospective multicenter study they included 378 patients. The median FiO2 was 50% (IQR 41 to 55%) and median PaO2 was 24,7 kPa (IQR 17,9 to 30,8 kPa); 185 mmHg (IQR 134 to 231). Referring to international guidelines, they observed a discrepancy between these international perioperative guidelines and evidence from other clinical contexts. Adult anesthesiologists seem to look for a balance and have to make a concession between these guidelines and the majority of other clinical evidence. This might sug- gest that Dutch pediatric anesthesiologists may be at least somewhat more cautious when it comes to intraoperative oxygen administration.'),\n",

A complete dataset of intraoperative values was available after extraction from the hospital servers. Due to its retrospective nature, we strongly rely on the punctual administrative competencies of other anesthetic healthcare workers. Principally, errors could have been made because of the time differences between blood withdrawal and registration of the ABG values in the EHR. The analyses done in this study were based on the time registered in this system for each specific ABG. However, real-time withdrawal occurred a few minutes before this registration. Therefore, uncertainty remains concerning these timeframes and the related oxygenation values.

Together with the retrospective nature of the study, it is challenging to pinpoint specific time points, such as induction, maintenance, or emergence of anesthesia, to clarify when the samples were obtained. Since there are still no clear international definitions on hypoxemia, normoxemia and hyperoxemia, one can argue about our chosen cut-off points, as these are merely arbitrary choices. These are not intended to conceal or amplify the fundamental discussion about supplemental ox- ygen use during pediatric anesthesia. Furthermore, no comments can be made regarding clinical outcomes since this was not part of the study. Although highly interesting, it is probably unfeasible to deduce the outcome parameters for the admin- istration of oxygen alone.

Besides, inclusion of longer procedures raises the likelihood of atelectasis formation and, in addi- tion, patients with hemodynamic instability and/or fluid shifts are more susceptible to pulmonary edema. At the same time, blood withdrawal was only performed at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. In some patients, an arterial catheter had already been placed, for example at the pediatric intensive care unit, although there was no need for blood sampling during the procedure. This could be the case if there was minimal blood loss or during very stable procedures. This could mean that only complex op- erations and complex patients were included and that our findings are only comparable with similar cases.

A more conservative approach to oxygen administration was observed in spe- cific subgroups, including emergency/urgent surgeries and (premature) neonates. Future research should focus on outcomes related to hyper- oxemia during pediatric anesthesia, for example clinical relevant pul- monary complications, postoperative wound infections, length of hospital stay and, although this might be challenging, mortality. Vali- dation by multicenter and prospective studies would strengthen our findings. If possible, these outcomes should be related to age. Moreover, it would be useful to reach consensus on definitions related to these topics before new studies are initiated.

In addition, certain type-related features and pitfalls should be taken into account in the operating theatre. In this narrative review, we discuss characteristics of types of diabetes other than type 2 diabetes relevant to the anaesthetist, based on available literature and data from our clinic. 1. Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is often considered a single disease entity in the perioperative period. The majority of patients with DM have type 2 DM (T2DM); the prevalence of type 1 DM (T1DM) is estimated to be only 5–10% of all patients with DM [1,2]. An even smaller portion of the population is diagnosed with a specific type of DM which is secondary to, or associated with, another disease or the use of specific medications. Examples of the latter are gestational DM (GDM), DM after pancreatitis, or DM induced by glucocorticoid use. The pathophysiology of these different types of DM vary signifi- cantly, and likewise do the patient characteristics and their expected glucose control [3–12]. Recent evidence suggests that prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 may increase the risk of DM.'),\n",

Recent evidence suggests that prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 may increase the risk of DM. [13–15] We have pre- viously shown that treating surgical patients with T1DM and T2DM during the perioperative period according to the same protocol resulted in a higher incidence of hyperglycaemia in patients with T1DM compared to patients with T2DM [3]. In a subsequent observational study, patients with certain uncommon forms of DM, such as DM after pancreatitis, were particularly vulnerable to perioperative glucose dys- regulation [16]. The association between poor perioperative glucose control and unfavourable outcome has been well-established in various surgical settings [17–20]. Similar correlations have been found between preoperative haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), which reflects long-term glucose control, and postoperative outcome [21–23]. Currently, most perioperative guidelines recommend preoperative evaluation of all patients with DM, yet pay little attention to the type of DM [24,25], while some even state that care for patients should be irrespective of type of DM [26].'),\n",

We here suggest a more individualised approach based on the specific type of DM and give an overview of types of DM other than T2DM, with a particular focus on clinical features relevant to physicians involved in their perioperative care. 2. Types of diabetes According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) “Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes” [27], DM may be categorised into one of the following groups: - 1) Type 1 diabetes, characterised by (mostly autoimmune induced) - insulin deficiency; - 2) Type 2 diabetes, characterised by the presence of insulin resistance - and varying degrees of insulin deficiency (accounts for 90–95% of - diabetic cases). This type of DM and its perioperative considerations - are subject of many excellent reviews [28–30] and is not the focus of - this paper; - 3) Gestational diabetes;'),\n",

The latter two are categorised together as type 3 diabetes, which includes many subtypes. Many patients with DM do not easily fit into one single category due to multiple contributing etiological factors. For instance, a patient may be diagnosed with post-transplant DM (PTDM) due to its onset being shortly after renal transplantation and prescription of immune modu- lating drugs. The same patient may already have had an undiscovered impaired glucose tolerance which would have later developed into T2DM. Thus, the circumstances present at the time of diagnosis often determines the type of DM. Furthermore, many forms of DM are clini- cally heterogeneous and considerable overlap between various forms exists, for example when a T1DM patient suffers from increasing insulin resistance due to obesity.'),\n",

Previously published data from a prospectively recorded cohort of patients who presented for surgery in our clinic showed that besides T2DM, the most frequently encountered types of DM were T1DM (40.8 per 10,000 surgeries), pancreatic DM (19.3 per 10,000) and GDM (14.3 per 10,000 surgeries, mostly caesarian sections) [16]. None of the remaining types of DM had an incidence >2.7 per 10,000 [16]. The different types of DM, including their pathophysiology and Table 1 Types of diabetes and specific concerns for the anaesthetist. characteristics relevant in the perioperative setting, have been sum- marised in Table 1. 2.1. Type 1 diabetes Immune-mediated destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells results in absolute insulin deficiency [31]. T1DM typically gets diagnosed during childhood or adolescence but can present at any age. Absolute insulin deficiency makes patients with T1DM dependent on exogenous insulin and prone to developing ketoacidosis (Fig. 1) [32]. Basal insulin should therefore never be omitted perioperatively – that is, ketogenesis should be suppressed either by continuous infusion of short- acting insulin or continuation of long-acting insulin.'),\n",

Most perioperative DM guidelines recommend continuing the regular evening dose of long- acting insulin on the day before surgery, irrespective of the type of DM. [24,25,33,34] However, in patients with recurrent episodes of hypo- glycaemia or in those scheduled for surgery in the afternoon, we recommend decreasing the evening dose by 25–50%. [35] While insulin is vitally important in T1DM, it carries an inherent risk of causing hypoglycaemia. The overall risk of hypoglycaemia is esti- mated to be three times higher in T1DM compared to insulin-treated T2DM [36]. This also appears to be true in the perioperative setting, where the incidence of hypoglycaemia was 7.1% in T1DM compared to'),\n",

In comparison with T2DM, perioperative hyperglycaemia has also been found to be more common in T1DM [3,16]. Likewise, HbA1c values are relatively high among T1DM patients undergoing surgery, reflecting the more challenging long term glucose regulation in T1DM [16,40]. The anaesthetist should therefore pay specific attention to glucose control in patients with T1DM during pre-operative screening.

However, the increased risk of both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia in T1DM highlights the importance of frequent monitoring of blood glucose values. In summary, the anaesthetist should always ensure basal insulin levels are met and remain vigilant for both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia. 2.1.1. Insulin pumps and glucose monitors Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) devices, more commonly referred to as insulin pumps, are increasingly used in the treatment of T1DM. These devices deliver basal insulin by continuous subcutaneous infusion of rapid-acting insulin, usually at variable pre- programmed rates, depending on the time of day. Patients may also use the device to calculate and administer the dose of insulin required to cover the additional need for insulin before food intake, based on their estimation of the carbohydrate content of a meal and a preset insulin-to- carbohydrate ratio [42]. Besides the obvious benefits of avoiding mul- tiple subcutaneous insulin injections throughout the day, CSII in com- parison with intermittent insulin injections has been shown to decrease HbA1c in T1DM [43].'),\n",

The programmed basal infusion Fig. 1. Pathophysiology and clinical featues of diabetic ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis is characterised by the triad of ketosis, acidosis and insulin defi- ciency, mostly resulting in hyperglycaemia. Absolute or relative insulin deficiency, together with an increased concentration of counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon and catecholamines, leads to an increased breakdown of triglycerides into glycerol and non-esterified free fatty acids (FFAs). Glycerol is used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis and FFAs are oxidised to ketone bodies in the liver. Low insulin also impairs the clearance of ketone bodies. Accumulation of ketone bodies, together with elevated levels of other organic acids such as D-lactate, may lead to acidosis.'),\n",

Accumulation of ketone bodies, together with elevated levels of other organic acids such as D-lactate, may lead to acidosis. Hyperglycaemia is caused by a combination of increased gluconeogenesis and glycogen- olysis in the presence of insulin deficiency, as well as impaired glucose utilization due to insulin resistance. Since glucose is an osmotically active substance, hyper- glycaemia may result in transmembrane shifts of water from the intracellular to extracellular space (causing dilutional hyponatraemia) and osmotic diuresis (causing hypovolaemia and dehydration). rate should be retrieved from the device during preoperative screening. Some guidelines suggest lowering the basal infusion rate of the CSII pump by 20–40% in the perioperative period [45], especially if the patient experienced hypoglycaemic episodes [34], whereas others state the usual rate can be continued [26,44]. If CSII pumps are used in the operating theatre, glucose values should be checked at least hourly, as catheter occlusion and pump failure can lead to ketoacidosis. Correction doses of insulin in case of hyperglycaemia should not be given via the CSII pump. Unfortunately, there are only few data on the use of CSII during surgery.'),\n",

It is considered safer to switch to intravenous insulin infusion in patients undergoing major surgery or long-lasting (> 2 h) procedures, as counterregulatory hormones may increase insulin requirements and haemodynamic fluctuations with decreased skin perfusion may theo- retically cause unpredictable subcutaneous adsorption of insulin.

CGM readings should therefore always be confirmed using standard laboratory or certified point-of-care testing, prior to making treatment decisions with respect to insulin therapy. Removing a CGM is undesirable if not necessary, since not all components are disposable and can be costly to replace. Finally, it should be noted that most commercially available CSII and CGM devices lack Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for perioperative use.

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) LADA is a specific form of auto-immune DM, although the added value of this diagnosis is debatable. Some epidemiological studies sug- gest that LADA may account for as much as 4.5–9.7% of all adult-onset cases of DM [56–58], due to the presence of islet-cell specific autoan- tibodies which are diagnostic for LADA [4].'),\n",

Consequently, these patients initially share many clinical features with T2DM and may therefore be misdiagnosed. Since the respective autoantibodies are not routinely assessed, LADA is most likely underdiagnosed. LADA is a heterogeneous form of DM due to variable degrees of insulin insufficiency and resis- tance [59]. The titre of the most prominent autoantibody, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), seems to be correlated with the degree of phenotypic similarity to T1DM – that is, a higher rate of insulin requirement, an increased risk for ketoacidosis and a relatively lower body mass index (BMI) [58,59]. Conversely, LADA with a low anti-GAD titre is clinically more similar to T2DM. Overall, compared to T2DM, patients with LADA tend to show fewer signs of the metabolic syndrome such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia [4]. Although disease progress is slow in LADA compared to T1DM [4], it could impact perioperative glucose control.'),\n",

Gestational diabetes mellitus During normal pregnancy, glucose uptake by the placenta lowers fasting glycaemia. Later in pregnancy, diabetogenic placental hormones (e.g. human placental lactogen and progesterone) result in postprandial hyperglycaemia and increasing insulin resistance [5]. DM during preg- nancy has become increasingly common. The global prevalence of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy is estimated to be 16.9%, of which 84% is GDM and the remainder is already known or previously undiagnosed DM [60]. GDM is defined as DM first diagnosed during pregnancy that was not clearly overt DM prior to gestation [31]. However, it may not always be possible to fully exclude pre-existing DM. Insulin resistance increases exponentially during the second trimester together with body weight, after which it levels off. GDM usually disappears soon after delivery, although both mother and child are at greater risk of devel- oping T2DM later in their lives [61].'),\n",

GDM usually disappears soon after delivery, although both mother and child are at greater risk of devel- oping T2DM later in their lives [61].

During the preoperative assessment of pregnant women, particular attention should be paid to glucose regulation and any glucose lowering agents used, blood pressure trends and concomitant disease. Since GDM is of recent onset by definition, the presence of end-organ damage in these women is extremely unlikely. Adequate glucose control during caesarean section is important, (cid:0) 1 (cid:0) 1) during since a maternal blood glucose above 8 mmol.l (144 mg.dl labour is associated with neonatal hypoglycaemia [64,65]. The latter is caused by high foetal insulin levels induced by maternal hyper- glycaemia, as glucose can freely pass through the placenta. In GDM specifically, the incidence of severe neonatal hypoglycaemia after de- livery is reported to be as high as 20% [66].

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) Several rare types of DM are caused by monogenic defects in β-cell function. MODY is the most common form of monogenic DM [32]. It is a group of autosomal dominantly inherited disorders which classically present before the age of 25. Depending on the type of mutation, insulin secretion is variably impaired, whereas insulin action is mostly unaf- fected. MODY2 and MODY3 are the most common subtypes, each ac- counting for 15–50% of all cases (Table 2) [6]. MODY2 is caused by mutations in the gene encoding glucokinase, which plays a central role as a glucose sensor in pancreatic β-cells [71]. Patients with MODY2 have only moderately elevated glucose concentrations, are generally asymp- tomatic, do not require pharmacologic treatment and rarely develop vascular complications [72].'),\n",

It seems reasonable to withhold any sulfonylureas on the day of surgery in order to prevent hypoglycaemia and to treat perioperative hyperglycaemia with insulin. Various pancreatic disorders may cause secondary DM, referred to as pancreatic or type 3c DM. The most common underlying cause is chronic pancreatitis, which is estimated to account for approximately three out of four cases [74]. Deficiency of insulin production due to extensive fibrosis and destruction of pancreatic islet tissue is the main mechanism by which chronic pancreatitis leads to DM, although hepatic and pe- ripheral insulin resistance also play a significant role [75,76]. More than half of the patients with DM secondary to chronic pancreatitis are insulin-dependent [77,78]. This proportion may even be higher in the surgical population: over 80% of patients with pancreatic DM in our clinic were insulin-dependent [40]. Other pancreatic disorders that may cause DM include pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hemochromatosis, cystic fibrosis (CF) and (post-)pancreatic surgery.'),\n",

Other pancreatic disorders that may cause DM include pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hemochromatosis, cystic fibrosis (CF) and (post-)pancreatic surgery. Outside the surgical setting, pancreatic DM has been associated with poorer glucose control compared to T2DM [7]. Data from our centre show that perioperative glucose control is also poor, considering that more than half of the pa- tients with pancreatic diabetes in the recovery ward had a measured (cid:0) 1 72–180 mg. blood glucose above target range (i.e. 4–10 mmol.l or (cid:0) 1) [16]. It is important to note that concomitant impairment of the dl counterregulatory glucagon secretion from pancreatic α-cells may cause marked glycaemic lability and an unpredictable response to exogenous insulin administration [79,80]. It makes sense for the anaesthetist to consider this a type-1-like form of DM requiring meticulous insulin dosing and frequent assessment of glucose values. 2.5.1. Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) CF is caused by absence or dysfunction of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator, a chloride channel which is normally present in the apical membranes of various epithelial cells, giving rise to thick, viscous secretions in multiple organs including the pancreas [8]. CFRD is present in 40–50% of adults diagnosed with CF [81].'),\n",

CFRD is present in 40–50% of adults diagnosed with CF [81]. The primary defect is severe insulin deficiency due to a reduction of β-cell mass [8]. Unlike T1DM, some residual insulin secretion is still present, making CFRD patients less prone to develop ketoacidosis. In our clinic, most CFRD patients were younger than 40 years old [16], reflecting the early onset of CFRD and the decreased life expectancy of these patients [81]. One third of these patients was treated with a continuous insulin pump. With a single exception that may be explained by corticosteroid administra- tion, the CRFD patients remained within glycaemic target range. 2.6. Diabetes secondary to endocrinopathies There is a number of endocrinopathies that may cause DM due to the excess release of counterregulatory hormones. Among these are growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in acromegaly, cortisol in hypercortisolism, and catecholamines in pheochromocytoma. Patients with these types of DM are not frequently encountered in the operating theatre–about 1 in every 10,000 surgical cases for each of the aforementioned endocrinopathies [16]. 2.6.1. Acromegaly Acromegaly is usually caused by a GH-secreting pituitary tumour.'),\n",

Acromegaly Acromegaly is usually caused by a GH-secreting pituitary tumour. DM is a common complication seen in over one third of all patients [82]. HbA1c values reported in patients with acromegaly are highly variable, (cid:0) 1 (5.9–7.0%) with mean values ranging from 41 to 53 mmol.mol [83,84]. GH is an anabolic hormone which affects glucose metabolism via various pathways, both directly and indirectly through IGF-1 stim- ulation. Excess secretion may lead to hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance and eventually β-cell dysfunction [9,85]. Treatment options for acro- megaly include transsphenoidal surgery, radiotherapy and somatostatin analogues. However, although these often improve glucose metabolism, DM may still persist after surgery if β-cell dysfunction is already present [86,87]. Although the disease duration is typically <10 years [86], some patients in our clinic were particularly insulin-resistant based on their daily dose of insulin and intraoperative insulin requirements [16]. Concomitant dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may further complicate glucose control. 2.6.2.'),\n",

Concomitant dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may further complicate glucose control. 2.6.2. Hypercortisolism The most common cause of endogenous hypercortisolism is Cushing's disease (CD), which is caused by uncontrolled release of adrenocorti- cotropic hormone (ACTH) from a pituitary adenoma. The prevalence of DM in CD is reported to be 20–45% [10]. Chronically elevated levels of glucocorticoids lead to reduced peripheral and hepatic insulin sensi- tivity [88], abnormal pancreatic insulin secretion and changes in adi- pose tissue biology [10]. Cortisol predominantly affects postprandial glucose levels, which may cause fasting glucose levels to remain normal [10]. Resection of the pituitary adenoma is the first-line treatment of CD with a remission rate between 65% and 90% [89], although insulin resistance may still persist afterwards [90]. Glucose should be measured at least once every two hours during surgery and insulin should be administered timely, especially in cases with poor preoperative glucose control.\"),\n",

It has been suggested that impairment of insulin secretion is the primary mechanism by which pheochromocytoma causes DM [92], although insulin resistance may also play a role [93]. Hypoglycaemia due to excessive rebound secretion of insulin after pheochromocytoma excision is a frequent complication after endocrine surgery, and is usually seen 1 to 6 h after surgery [94,95]. It would be reasonable to monitor patients who underwent pheochromocytoma excision during the first 6 h after surgery at a post anaesthesia care unit for hourly glucose measurement and, if necessary, glucose administration. 2.7. Drug- or chemical-induced diabetes Various drugs or chemicals have the potential to precipitate DM, e.g. by destroying pancreatic β-cells, impairing insulin action or inducing islet cell antibodies. Chronic systemic glucocorticoid treatment can lead to DM through mechanisms comparable to endogenous hypercortisolism [88]. Patients being treated with systemic glucocorticoids develop DM in 18.6% of cases [11].'),\n",

Patients being treated with systemic glucocorticoids develop DM in 18.6% of cases [11]. Preoperative fasting glucose is generally low in these patients, as glucocorticoids preferentially affect postprandial glucose levels [96]. However, postoperative peak glucose can be significantly increased [16], reflecting insulin resistance caused by a combination of surgical stress and corticosteroid “stress dose” administration. Post-transplant Diabetes Mellitus (PTDM) has largely replaced the term New-Onset Diabetes After Transplantation (NODAT), since the latter implies exclusion of pre-existing DM which may not always be the case [97]. More than three out of four cases of PTDM occur within the first three months after transplantation [98]. The cumulative incidence of PTDM depends on the transplanted organ, and is estimated to be [98]: - - 10–20% after kidney transplantation; - - 20–30% after heart transplantation; - - 20–40% after lung transplantation; - - 30–40% after liver transplantation. PTDM is listed as a drug-induced form of DM, because the immu- nosuppressive agents used after transplantation are a major contributor to the development of PTDM [31,97–99] (Table 3).'),\n",

Calcineurin in- hibitors are known to considerably impair insulin secretion, tacrolimus more so than cyclosporin A [100]. Other possible contributing factors include increased insulin degradation by the transplant kidney, physical inactivity after transplantation, as well as the β-cell toxic effect of the resulting hyperglycaemia itself [99]. Patients with PTDM and hyperglycaemia have an increased risk of transplant rejection, infection and hospitalisation [101]. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid perioperative hyperglycaemia. In addition, renal transplant recipients may have a high rate of hypoglycaemia due to the influence of reduced and fluctuating renal function on glucose lowering agents, in particular sulfonylureas [12,102]. This should also be taken into account in the perioperative setting. 3. Conclusion Perioperative management of types of DM other than T2DM is un- derappreciated in the literature and guidelines. Although some general principles apply to all patients with DM, many forms of DM carry their own characteristic features. Understanding these features will help cli- nicians provide optimal perioperative diabetes care and prevent complications.'),\n",

We discuss current data, guideline recommendations, and best practice advice on effective management of the direct oral anticoagulants and regional anesthesia, including in speciﬁc clinical situations, such as patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery at high risk of a thromboembolic event, or patients with renal impairment at an increased risk of bleeding. © 2016 The Authors.

The risk of VTE is particularly high in patients who undergo major orthopedic surgery, such as total knee or hip replacement surgery [4]; therefore, these patients routinely receive anticoagulants for short-term peri- operative and postoperative thromboprophylaxis [4,5]. Whether a patient is receiving long-term anticoagulation (for the treatment or prevention of VTE or for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial ﬁbrillation [AF]) prior to orthopedic surgery should also be considered because appro- priate anticoagulant management based on the risk of throm- boembolism and bleeding is crucial in these patients [5]. Additionally, the use of regional neuraxial anesthesia poses a risk of hematoma in patients receiving anticoagulants, because of the insertion and removal of the needle and catheter. The direct oral anticoagulants (OACs) apixaban, rivaroxa- ban, and dabigatran are approved for the prevention of VTE after elective knee or hip replacement surgery in the European Union and/or United States, as well as for the prevention of'),\n",

In Europe, rivaroxaban is also indicated for co-administration with acetyl- salicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine for the prevention of atherothrombotic events after acute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers [10]. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct inhibitors of Factor Xa, whereas dabigatran is a direct inhibitor of thrombin. All three agents have been found to exhibit predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and have a fast onset of action—reaching maximum plasma concentration rapidly after oral administration (apixaban, 3-4 hours; rivarox- aban, 2-4 hours; dabigatran, 0.5-2.0 hours) [6,8,10,12–15].

Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacody- namic characteristics are not inﬂuenced to a clinically mean- ingful extent by body weight, age, or gender, which collectively indicate that these direct OACs can be given as ﬁxed dosing regimens without the need for routine coagulation monitoring [16–20]. The routes of drug elimination differ be- tween the 2 drug classes: apixaban and rivaroxaban have mul- tiple pathways including renal excretion (~ 27% and 66% [33% as active drug and 33% after metabolic degradation], re- spectively), whereas elimination of dabigatran is predominant- ly via the renal system (85%) [6,8,10,21]. In patients receiving dabigatran for the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replace- ment surgery, a dose reduction is required in those with mod- erate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL min−1), those aged 75 years or over, and those taking concomitant mild-to-moderate P-glycoprotein inhibitors [8].

Despite the clinical evidence on the safety and efﬁcacy proﬁle of direct OACs demonstrated in clinical trials, physicians—particularly anesthesiologists—need to be aware of how to minimize the risks of bleeding complications when treat- ing patients who are taking an anticoagulant and are due to under- go surgery with regional anesthesia. Regional anesthesia techniques have become increasingly pop- ular because they offer several beneﬁts over general anesthesia and traditional systemic analgesia, including reduced risk of mortality and less postoperative pain, thus facilitating early postoperative mobilization of the limbs and consequently reducing the chances of postoperative VTE [31,32]. Regional anesthesia is used in millions of operations each year and, at a time when the use of the direct OACs is growing, bleeding-related complications could arise if appropriate guidance is not followed [33].'),\n",

Moreover, current guideline recommendations will be discussed and best practice in speciﬁc clinical situations, such as in patients with renal impairment who are at an increased risk of bleeding, will be highlighted. The most common complications of regional anesthesia include postdural puncture headache (occurs in 0.1%-36% of patients but rarely lasts longer than 7 days) [34], backache (af- fects up to 11% of patients in the 5 days after the procedure) [35], and peripheral nerve damage (eg, transient paresthesia is estimated in up to 8%-10% of patients in the immediate days after regional anesthesia) [36]. Serious complications, such as spinal or epidural hematoma and epidural abscess, are rare and therefore difﬁcult to study in detail [37].

Risk factors associated with regional anesthesia In a systematic review of 141 studies (n = 9559), neuraxial anesthesia was shown to be associated with lower rates of mortality (2.1% vs 3.1%; odds ratio [OR] 0.7; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 0.54-0.90; P = .006), occurrence of DVT (odds reduction of 44%; OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.43-0.72; P b .001) and PE (odds reduction of 55%; OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.29-0.69; P b .001), among other outcomes [31]. A more re- cent observational study showed that neuraxial anesthesia was associated with a signiﬁcantly reduced need for blood transfu- sions compared with patients receiving general anesthesia (28.5% vs 44.7%; OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.45-0.61; P b .0001) af- ter simultaneous bilateral total knee replacement surgery [40]. 2.2. Risk factors for the development of spinal hematoma The overall incidences of hematoma in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia (epidural and spinal) have been estimated to be as low as 1 in 220 000 and 1 in 320 000, respectively, in the absence of traumatic puncture and without the use of hep- arin or ASA [41].'),\n",

Patient-related factors increasing the risk of spinal hematoma Regarding patient-related factors, clinicians must exercise particular care with elderly patients requiring surgical inter- vention—these patients are at increased risk of thrombo- embolic disorders [46,47] and are, therefore, more likely to be receiving anticoagulants. Furthermore, the bleeding risk in elderly patients receiving anticoagulants is augmented [48,49]. Elderly patients are also more likely to have renal or he- patic impairment, causing increased drug plasma concentrations, and consequently drug elimination may be slower in these patients [50]. Real-world data from the RIETE (Registro Infor- matizado de Pacientes con Enfermedad TromboEmbólica) registry have shown major and fatal bleeding to be more com- mon in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy who were aged ≥ 80 years compared with those aged b 80 years (3.4% vs 2.1% and 0.8% vs 0.4%, respectively) [51].

Inﬂuence of anesthesia in patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants: evidence from phase III clinical studies with a focus on major orthopedic surgery Given the increasing utilization of direct OACs for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic disorders, it is crucial to evaluate the risk of compressive hematoma and the impact on clinical outcomes when regional anesthesia is used. To discuss the effect of regional anesthesia on the risk of com- pressive hematoma and bleeding risk, we searched PubMed with no date restrictions for phase III clinical trials comparing ‘apixaban’, ‘rivaroxaban’, or ‘dabigatran’ with ‘standard of care’/‘low molecular weight heparin’ for ‘VTE prevention’/ ‘thromboprophylaxis’ after ‘total knee or hip replacement surgery’/‘knee or hip arthroplasty’ and for studies investigating ‘spinal hematoma’ after ‘regional anesthesia’. It is worth noting the risk of spinal hematoma with regional anesthesia when receiving traditional anticoagulants.

Providing neuraxial anesthesia and the timing of needle/catheter insertion/removal in patients who are receiving or are to receive anticoagulant therapy involves individual assessment of the risks and beneﬁts of such a procedure, together with rigorous management of anticoagulation activity and monitoring for signs of neurological dysfunction.

Patients who undergo joint replacement surgery are typically elderly, often with renal impairment and receiving antiplatelet therapy; for these patients, a waiting time of 3-5 half-lives could be more appropriate if hemostatic safety is not assured (Table 4). To prevent VTE after major orthopedic surgery, the direct OACs have to be administered in the postoperative period when adequate hemostasis has been established, as determined by the treating physician. Recently, the direct OACs have been approved for long-term prevention of thromboembolic events in non-valvular AF, and for the treatment and secondary prophylaxis of VTE. Every year, 15%-20% of patients receiving therapeutic doses of anti- coagulants require perioperative temporary interruption, and the characteristics of both the patients and the procedures should be considered when scheduling interruption and resumption. 4.1.1.

Imberti et al suggested a discontinuation of rivar- oxaban at least 48 hours prior to procedures involving a standard risk of bleeding, such as orthopedic surgery; for procedures with a high risk of bleeding (neuraxial block), rivaroxaban should be stopped 72 hours before the intervention [69]. In the authors' opinion, patients with AF with standard bleeding risk (HAS-BLED score b 3) could undergo neuraxial anesthesia 48 hours after the last rivaroxaban intake, whereas in patients with high bleeding risk, neuraxial anesthesia should be delayed for 4 days, and this type of anesthesia should not be considered in cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance b 30 mL min−1) [69].\"),\n",

Laboratory measurement of direct oral anticoagulants In the context of perioperative management of patients who are receiving a direct OAC, the concentration of the direct OAC can be determined if, for example, an emergency surgical intervention is required by an anticoagulated patient.

Laboratory measurement of rivaroxaban The PT can be used to determine the relative anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban [71,73]. However, PT is not speciﬁc and can be inﬂuenced by factors such as cancer, hepatic impairment, and vitamin K deﬁciency [74,75]. Furthermore, there is marked variability in the sensitivity of the reagents available for obtaining PT results for rivaroxaban; only a sensitive reagent, such as Neoplastin Plus (Diagnostica Stago, Asnières-sur-Seine, France), should be used [76]. Importantly, the international normalized ratio must not be used for rivarox- aban. The quantitative measurement of plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban can be performed using anti-Factor Xa chromogenic assays (eg, STA Rotachrom, Diagnostica Stago, Asnières-sur-Seine, France) with validated calibrators [77]. When anti-Factor Xa assays are unavailable, a PT test with a reagent sensitive to rivaroxaban may be used to conﬁrm the absence or presence of an anticoagulant effect (if the sampling time after last tablet intake is known) [76,78,79]. 4.2.3. Laboratory measurement of dabigatran The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay, for example, provides a qualitative measure of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran [73].

The aPTT assay may be useful in dabigatran-treated patients who require emergency interventions to exclude any clinically relevant dabigatran anticoagulant effect [71,80]. The ecarin clotting time (ECT) assay provides a direct measurement of the activity of dabiga- tran, but is not readily available [71]. Calibrated ecarin chro- mogenic assays are also available (eg, Ecarin Chromogenic Assay, Diagnostica Stago, Asnières-sur-Seine, France) and may allow faster ECT measurements than the ECT assay [71]. Direct thrombin inhibitor assays (such as the HEMOCLOT assay, HYPHEN BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise, France) can be used for the quantitative measurement of plasma concentrations of dabigatran [81].

Use of non-neuraxial regional techniques and direct oral anticoagulants in clinical practice Total knee and hip replacement surgery causes intense postoperative pain, which may impair rehabilitation and mobi- lization, prolong hospitalization, and increase the risk of VTE [85]. The use of continuous peripheral nerve blocks (femoral and lumbar plexus blocks) for hip and knee surgery may offer advantages as a ﬁrst strategy to balance the risk of hematoma in anticoagulated patients compared with epidural analgesia. The results from a systematic review of randomized controlled trials support the use of peripheral nerve blocks as a ﬁrst choice of analgesia after major orthopedic surgery; femoral nerve block provided a similar analgesic proﬁle to epidural analgesia, with fewer side-effects after total knee replacement sur- gery [86]. Lumbar plexus block represents the ﬁrst analgesic choice after total hip replacement surgery [87]. However, both lumbar plexus and femoral nerve blocks are still associated with loss of quadricep muscle strength [88,89].'),\n",

However, both lumbar plexus and femoral nerve blocks are still associated with loss of quadricep muscle strength [88,89]. A study has suggested that an adductor canal block after knee surgery may provide a similar analgesic proﬁle but without quadricep weakness after total knee replacement surgery [88]. Although no difference was observed between the 2 anesthesia tech- niques in terms of morphine use or level of pain, quadricep strength was signiﬁcantly better preserved with an adductor canal block than with a femoral nerve block (52% median of baseline vs 18%, P = .004) [88]. Peripheral nerve blocks have been associated with a potential for wound hematoma with administration of heparin in some studies [57,90–93] but not others [94]. The potential severity of a hematoma in a non- compressible site and the lack of evidence on which to base recommendations for the particular use of continuous periph- eral nerve blocks have led the ESA and ASRA guidelines to suggest expanding the clinical recommendations for neuraxial anesthesia to deeper peripheral nerve blocks, such as lumbar plexus [41,57]. Studies speciﬁcally investigating the use of apixaban after non-neuraxial blocks in orthopedic surgery seem to be lacking. However, there are some available data for rivaroxaban and dabigatran.'),\n",

In a post hoc pooled analysis of 3 phase III clinical trials of dabigatran (220 mg or 150 mg once daily) versus enoxaparin for VTE prevention after knee or hip replacement surgery, in which 19% (n = 1539) received a combination of general anes- thesia or neuraxial anesthesia plus peripheral nerve block, rates of major VTE and VTE-related mortality were slightly higher with general anesthesia compared with neuraxial or combina- tion anesthesia, although not signiﬁcantly so, and neither were there signiﬁcant differences in efﬁcacy or safety outcomes between dabigatran and enoxaparin [63]. Patients undergoing elective major orthopedic surgery receive thromboprophylaxis because of their increased risk of developing VTE. With the overall aging of the population, more patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery are likely to be receiving anticoagulation therapy for thromboembolic disorders prior to their surgical procedure. Several direct OACs are currently approved for different therapeutic indica- tions, including prevention of VTE after elective knee or hip replacement surgery, and their use in clinical practice has been growing.'),\n",

Effective management of these direct OACs and regional anesthesia is essential to avoid bleeding complica- tions and is, therefore, a topic of crucial interest for anesthesi- ologists. Thromboprophylaxis with all direct OACs may start between 1 and 24 hours after surgery [6,8,10], provided that hemostasis has been achieved, and thus should present a lower theoretical risk of bleeding or neuraxial hematoma in case of central blocks, in comparison with preoperatively initiated LMWH. After surgery, restarting direct OACs can be delayed by up to 48 hours in cases of bleeding or a difﬁcult neuraxial block, and protection against thromboembolic events is achieved within hours after the ﬁrst dose of these agents and without the need for bridging therapy. The effect of the type of anesthesia on clinical outcomes of the direct OACs is still unclear. Subanalyses of RE-MODEL, RE-NOVATE, and RE-MOBILIZE data suggest that, irrespective of the anesthe- sia used, neuraxial anesthesia was associated with a lower risk'),\n",

These recommendations are based on three usual pillars of PBM: optimizing red cell mass, minimizing blood loss and optimizing anemia tolerance. In the preoperative period, these guidelines recommend detecting anemia and iron deﬁciency and taking corrective measures well in advance of surgery, when possible, in case of surgery with moderate to high bleeding risk or known preoperative anemia. In the intraoperative period, the use of tranexamic acid and some surgical techniques are recommended to limit bleeding in case of high bleeding risk or in case of hemorrhage, and the use of cell salvage is recommended in some surgeries with a major risk of transfusion. In the postoperative period, the limitation of blood samples is recommended but the * Corresponding author at: De´ partement d’Anesthe´ sie-Re´ animation, CHU d’Angers, 4 rue Larrey, 49100, Angers, France.

Perioperative bleeding may aggravate or be responsible for anemia, which is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality [3–5]. Frequently per- formed in the most anemic patients in surgical settings, transfu- sion may itself be an independent factor of mortality and morbidity, regardless of the patient’s hemoglobin (Hb) levels and comorbidities [5,6]. There is therefore a double need to correct or limit perioperative anemia when surgeries are at risk of bleeding, and to avoid or limit the use of transfusion during this period. PBM is now recommended by a large number of medical authorities in various countries and specialties, including the World Health Organization [2]. Three pillars are classically presented, which are the three main objectives of perioperative PBM programs: - (cid:3) Optimization of red cell mass - (cid:3) Minimization of blood loss - (cid:3) Optimization of anemia tolerance. Perioperative PBM programs are recommended for all surgeries at risk of bleeding, with measures adapted to the procedure and to the patient. In September 2022, the French National Authority for Health (HAS) published recommendations covering all aspects of perioperative PBM [7].'),\n",

In view of the absence of French recommendations on this topic, and given the major public health (decrease in morbidity and mortality) and economic (lower consumption of blood products) potential implications, the French Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine (SFAR) and the National Collective of Obese Associations (CNAO) initiated the referral of this issue to the French National Authority for Health (HAS) in June 2019.

After a critical analysis of the literature, recommendations were formulated with supporting arguments, each graded according to the level of evidence: A, B, C, or expert agreement (EA) (Table 2 ). These Good Practice Recommendations have been established according to the method described in the HAS methodological guide available on its website: ‘‘Developing of Good Practice Recommendations’’ [8]. An external revision phase was carried out by a review group (44 people proposed by the CNPs or academic societies or members concerned with the theme).

Management of preoperative anemia and iron deﬁciency The algorithm summarizing the recommendations of this part is presented in Fig. 1. 3.1. Preoperative screening for anemia and iron deﬁciency Rationale. Before these new guidelines, French and international guidelines already recommended the prescription of a blood count before surgery with intermediate or high cardiac risk [9,10], or if the probability of perioperative transfusion was >10% or perioperative blood loss >500 mL [11]. Prior to surgery at risk of bleeding or transfusion, the optimal Hb level seems to be at least 13 g/dL, regardless of gender [11]. This risk must be adapted according to the center and the patien’s comorbidities. In the event of a preoperative Hb level <13 g/dL, an etiological diagnosis must be made in order to optimize the treatment of the anemia [11].'),\n",

In the event of a preoperative Hb level <13 g/dL, an etiological diagnosis must be made in order to optimize the treatment of the anemia [11]. Iron deﬁciency is the leading cause of anemia in the general population [12] and the prevalence of iron deﬁciency is high in patients, especially in cases of cancer (40–60%) [13], chronic renal failure (around 50%) [14] or heart failure (40–50% and up to 75% depending on the study) [15,16]. Besides these conditions, its prevalence is also often high before scheduled orthopedic surgery (from 20% to 57%) [17,18] or before cardiac surgery (around 40%) [19]. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of iron deﬁciency is based on measurements of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT), possibly associated with C-reactive protein measurement to identify inﬂammation [11,12]. The serum ferritin thresholds for the diagnosis of iron deﬁciency in the preoperative context remain poorly deﬁned and are probably between 30 and 100 mg/mL, i.e., higher than outside the perioperative situation. Indeed, these patients will have increased iron requirements due to periopera- tive blood loss, which is a direct loss of iron. A value of TSAT < 20% helps for the diagnosis of iron deﬁciency in the case of serum ferritin between 30 and 100 mg/mL [11] or between 100 and'),\n",

Many studies have shown the value of iron treatment for optimizing Hb levels in the preoperative period. A recent meta- analysis showed a signiﬁcant reduction in the need for transfusion when intravenous iron was used preoperatively in orthopedic surgery, but this analysis also included studies with erythropoie- sis-stimulating agents (ESAs) [21]. Another meta-analysis of patients undergoing surgery for a fracture of the upper extremity of the femur reached a similar conclusion [22]. However, in the context of major orthopedic surgery, it is the use of EPO, systematically associated with iron, which has shown greater efﬁcacy in reducing perioperative transfusion (see Section 3.2.2). In digestive surgery, several studies, including randomized controlled trials, have demonstrated the value of oral or intrave- nous iron therapy prior to major colorectal or abdominal surgery, in particular, to reduce the need for perioperative transfusion [23– 26]. Although preoperative iron therapy did not always have an impact on perioperative transfusion in major digestive surgery, postoperative Hb levels were signiﬁcantly increased several weeks after surgery in many studies [25]. In this context, intravenous iron appears to be more effective than oral iron in rapidly increasing Hb [27,28].'),\n",

Intravenous iron appears to be more effective than oral iron in increasing serum ferritin even when Hb levels have not risen signiﬁcantly in the 3 weeks following injection [30].

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents Rationale. The efﬁcacy of ESAs prior to surgery (particularly orthopedic or cardiac surgeries) has been evaluated in many studies and meta-analyses [32–35]. In these studies, ESAs were shown to increase perioperative Hb levels and reduce periopera- tive transfusion and postoperative complications. In hemorrhagic orthopedic surgery, the use of ESAs in the preoperative period is currently recommended only in cases of anemia, whatever the cause of anemia, due to the potential risk of venous or arterial thrombosis [36]. When ESAs are used in this context, the beneﬁt appears to be greater, with no apparent increased risk of thrombosis [33,35,37].'),\n",

When ESAs are used in this context, the beneﬁt appears to be greater, with no apparent increased risk of thrombosis [33,35,37]. In cardiac surgery, the beneﬁt of ESAs mainly concerns the reduction in perioperative transfusions in randomized controlled trials using single injections [38,39] and the reduction of postoperative renal failure [40]. Erythropoietins alpha (in biosimilar or non-biosimilar form) and zeta have now marketing authorization for their use to correct anemia prior to major orthopedic surgery. Various doses have been evaluated in the literature, with 600 IU/kg by subcutaneous injection (often rounded up to 40,000 IU) appearing to be the most widely used and more effective than 300 IU/kg [32–35,41]. ESAs administered preoperatively should always be combined with iron therapy, even in the absence of iron deﬁciency associated with anemia, due to the increased iron requirement resulting from the stimulation of erythropoiesis. Intravenous iron is preferable, as several studies have shown its superiority (with a single injection of ferric carboxymaltose) over oral iron in increasing Hb levels more rapidly and limiting preoperative iron deﬁciency when ESA therapy is administered prior to major orthopedic surgery [42,43] or before cardiac surgery [38,44].'),\n",

An example of preoperative EPO and IV iron administration is shown in Fig. 2. In cancer patients, the efﬁcacy of ESAs in increasing Hb levels and reducing transfusion has been demonstrated [46–48].

If the etiology of the anemia is not known and not related to the surgery, experts recommend obtaining it, especially in case of Hb <10–11 g/dL, either directly or using a referral to another specialist (e.g., hepato-gastroenterologist, gynecologist, internist, hematologist). Indeed, even if iron deﬁciency is diag- nosed and treated, the knowledge of the etiology of this iron deﬁciency (in particular blood loss linked to gastrointestinal or gynecological bleeding) can facilitate the correction of this anemia after surgery. However, this diagnosis is sometimes difﬁcult to make in clinical practice before surgery, due to the sometimes short times before surgery (especially in the case of semi-urgent surgery or cancer surgery). This etiological assessment can then be carried out postoperatively. This recommendation is an expert agreement because there is little or no data evaluating the value of the referral to an anemia specialist (other than an anesthetist or the surgeon). However, some international guidelines have already recommended the use of a specialist for certain types of anemia [52].'),\n",

Many studies and meta-analyses have demon- strated its efﬁcacy in reducing blood loss and intra- and postoperative transfusion in almost all potentially hemorrhagic surgeries, the majority of studies having been performed in major hip and knee surgery and in cardiac surgery [53–55].

Thus, the prophylactic use of tranexamic acid is recommended with a Grade A for orthopedic and cardiac surgeries and with a Grade B for other surgeries with a hemorrhagic risk, for prophylactic or curative purposes. Tranexamic acid is effective on these parameters when used intravenously, ‘‘topically’’ by the surgeon, or orally, and seems even more effective when a ‘‘topical’’ and intravenous combination is used, particularly in major orthopedic surgery [53]. However, in the absence of contraindications, the intravenous route is the most studied route in this context and should be preferred. This is the reason why the preferential use of the intravenous route is recommended with a Grade B in these guidelines.

The dose and frequency of injections are still debated in the literature. However, if used intravenously, a dose of at least 1 g (or around 15 mg/kg if weight less than 65 kg), if possible before or at the same time as the surgical incision, is probably to be preferred in scheduled surgery where there is a risk of bleeding, as in the hemorrhagic shock and in postpartum hemorrhage [58–60]. Exclud- ing hemorrhagic shock, repeating doses, or continuing an infusion in the hours following surgery is possible but its beneﬁt has not been proven. In cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass, larger doses of around 50–100 mg/kg are regularly used in cardiac surgery centers and in studies on the subject [61–64]. These higher doses are associated with a statistically signiﬁcant, but sometimes clinically irrelevant, reduction in bleeding and transfusion [61,62]. In addition, higher doses are associated in several studies with an increased risk of seizures [64]. Thus, doses higher than 100 mg/kg should not be used and doses below 50 mg/kg and close to common doses used in non-cardiac surgery are probably sufﬁcient.

Among the existing techniques for heating, forced-air warming systems seem effective in limiting blood loss [79]. Since anemia and hemorrhage are major risk factors for morbidity and mortality in the perioperative period, these two parameters must be closely monitored during surgery. The amount of blood loss can be estimated in containers or graduated collection bags, by the weight of the compresses, and visually in the operating ﬁeld, the operator’s gown, and the ﬂoor. This monitoring of blood loss can make it possible to anticipate symptomatic or corrective treatment before the appearance of clinical signs or to undertake surgical or medicinal therapeutic measures.

Postoperative management in the context of patient blood management 5.1. Monitoring and detection of postoperative bleeding and anemia Rationale. The prevalence of postoperative anemia is around 80–90% after major orthopedic surgery [82] and 76% in cancer colorectal surgery [83]. Bleeding is a major complication of surgery, which can lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality, mean length of stay, and risk of admission to an intensive care unit [1].'),\n",

In a study of patients undergoing lower-limb arthroplasty (hip or knee) or coronary artery bypass grafting, transfusion was predicted in 97% of patients by three independent variables: preoperative Hb level, degree of perioperative bleeding, and postoperative minimal Hb level [84]. Hb measurement is a routine postoperative test and, for most uncomplicated surgeries, Hb levels begin to rise after the 3rd or 4th postoperative day only. Non-invasive Hb monitoring devices may be of interest in the postoperative period too for monitoring occult bleeding, follow-up of hemorrhage, or response to treatment of anemia, but further studies are needed to assess their value. Diagnosis of postoperative iron deﬁciency can be difﬁcult, as the iron markers (serum ferritin and TSAT) are disturbed in the hours following surgery. Inﬂammation is almost always present, and is responsible for increased ferritin synthesis. Serum ferritin and TSAT are generally interpretable the ﬁrst days after surgery [85]. In the postoperative period, the decrease of Hb levels is almost always related to blood loss (excluding hemodilution or hemoly-'),\n",

In most cases, this decrease of Hb levels results in direct iron loss, which can lead to iron deﬁciency if reserves were already low, and increasing Hb levels will therefore require iron supplementa- tion. Consequently, if anemia appears or is more severe than preoperatively, oral or intravenous supplementation is necessary if the anemia is to be rapidly corrected. The indication for iron therapy is then based on the Hb level and not on serum ferritin. Furthermore, if iron supplementation (including intravenous iron) allows an increase in the hemoglobin level, this will be especially visible from the second to fourth weeks following the supplemen- tation [86]. It is therefore after this time interval that it may be necessary to control the hemoglobin level.

Rationale. Several randomized controlled trials have shown that intravenous iron supplementation reduces transfusion, length of stay, postoperative infection rates, and fatigue [17,29,87]. Some intravenous iron formulations, in particular the ferric carboxy- maltose available in France, allow rapid infusion (15–60 min) of the necessary dose of iron (often around 1000 mg) and therefore allow, despite their higher cost, to be carried out at once during hospitalization and to avoid prolonged hospitalization or rehospi- talization for infusion of a 2nd or 3rd dose to complete the estimated total dose.'),\n",

The dose of iron to be injected must be adapted to the Hb level (e.g., using the Ganzoni formula), the preoperative iron status, the extent of the decrease of Hb level, and any perioperative transfusion (one unit of packed red blood cells provides an average of 200 mg of iron). However, transfusion is not a contraindication to iron injections since, according to the rules of a ‘‘restrictive’’ transfusion strategy, the post-transfusion Hb level should in all cases be below 10 g/dL. Major adverse effects such as anaphylaxis, infection or oxidative stress have been described with intravenous iron (mostly with dextran iron), but such side effects do not appear to be signiﬁcant with newer preparations such as ferric carboxymaltose, iron isomaltoside and low-molecular-weight dextran iron. A normal Hb level does not exclude the presence of iron deﬁciency. Iron deﬁciency anemia occurs at a relatively advanced stage of iron deﬁciency. Patients who are not anemic, but whose iron stores are depleted, may present symptoms associated with this deﬁciency, in particular asthenia and reduced exercise tolerance [88].'),\n",

Transfusion and transfusion thresholds Rationale. Transfusion of packed red blood cells to correct perioperative anemia and blood loss is an independent risk factor for increased postoperative morbidity, mortality and length of stay [89]. Since the 2000s, many studies with a high level of evidence and several meta-analyses have shown that restrictive transfusion thresholds (Hb generally between 7 and 8 g/dL versus more than 10 g/dL) are well tolerated, do not increase morbidity and mortality at 30 or 90 days, and make it possible to avoid or reduce blood transfusion [90–92].'),\n",

A recent meta-analysis that identiﬁed 19 systematic reviews pooling data from 68 randomized controlled trials reported no signiﬁcant difference in mortality between restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies [93]. The restrictive strategy therefore appears safe as it reduces the number of patients transfused and the number of units of packed red blood cells received, without signiﬁcantly modifying death rates and overall morbidity. French [36] or international guidelines [94–96] use Hb at 7 g/dL as the transfusion trigger threshold for patients with no particular history and who are hemodynamically stable. However, transfusion should not be guided by Hb alone, but by clinical tolerance. For elderly patients or those with a history of cardiovascular disease, many studies showed that transfusion thresholds should probably be less stringent than for the rest of the population, i.e. at least above 8 g/dL, and adapted to the patient’s tolerance [97–99].'),\n",

The values of these thresholds remain however theoretical, as most studies include methodological and statistical biases (deﬁnition of a restrictive or liberal threshold, timing of randomization sometimes done after transfusion, and deﬁnition of the Hb threshold to be reached). The fundamental criterion therefore remains the clinical tolerance of the anemia. One single (versus multiple) unit of packed red blood cells per transfusion in patients without active hemorrhage and hemody- namically stable with clinical reassessment and/or with a different Hb level (post-transfusion) is a recommendation taken up by many international guidelines, based on medical common sense and on studies with currently a low level of evidence (retrospective or before-after studies).

Anesthetic care for these patients is challenging, due to their pre- maturity and critical illness with hemodynamic instability. Currently, there are no guidelines for anesthetic care for these vulnerable patients. Therefore, this study aimed to describe current anesthesia practices across Europe for infants undergoing surgery for NEC. Design: Cross-sectional survey study. Participants: Anesthesiologists working in centers where surgery for NEC is performed across Europe. Measurements: A 46-item questionnaire assessing protocols for anesthesia practice, preoperative care, intra- operative care, postoperative care, and the respondent’s opinion on the adequacy of anesthetic care for patients with NEC in their center.'),\n",

For intravenous induction, they mostly used propofol (n = 58, 44%), followed by midazolam (n = 43, 33%) and esketamine (n = 42, 32%). For maintenance of anesthesia, inhalation anesthetic agents were more commonly used (solely: n = 71, 41%; in combination: n = 37, 22%), almost exclusively with sevoflurane. Postoperative analgesics mainly included paracetamol and/or morphine. Sixty percent of the respondents (n = 104) considered their anesthetic care for patients with NEC adequate. Suggestions for further improvement mainly revolved around monitoring, protocols, and collaboration. Conclusions: Anesthesia practice for infants undergoing surgery for NEC was highly variable. Most respondents considered the provided anesthetic care for patients with NEC adequate, but also recognized opportunities for further improvement, especially with regards to monitoring, protocols, and interdisciplinary collaboration. 1.

This condition is marked by progressive intestinal inflammation and ischemia as well as critical illness with respiratory and hemodynamic instability. Its treatment consists of con- servative management (e.g., antibiotics and bowel rest) combined with surgery in the most severe cases [2]. Surgical treatment is required in two thirds of infants with confirmed NEC and entails resection of the affected part of the intestine [3], under anesthesia. Providing adequate anesthetic care is essential but challenging in preterm infants with NEC, since these patients are often extremely premature and suffer from excessive inflammation, respiratory and he- modynamic instability, electrolyte disturbances, and coagulopathy [4–6]. Furthermore, as NEC is a rare disease, anesthesiologists may have limited experience treating these patients, which in turn is related to increased risk of complications [7,8]. Currently, the optimal anesthetic care for infants undergoing surgery for NEC is unknown and practices may vary considerably as there are no international guidelines and evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of many anesthetics in infants is lacking [9].'),\n",

Study design and participants We conducted a cross-sectional study to describe perioperative anesthetic care provided to preterm infants undergoing surgery across Europe for NEC. For this purpose, we developed a web-based survey. Anesthesiologists working in centers where surgery for NEC is per- formed, were requested to complete the survey. Participants were informed that completing the survey meant agreeing to participate in this study. This study was deemed exempt from ethical approval in line with the Dutch Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO), as it was a voluntary and anonymous survey among clinicians. 2.2. Survey We developed the survey in LimeSurvey version 2.06 (Limesurvey GmbH, Hamburg, Germany).

To establish the validity of the survey, an in- ternational group of six anesthesiologists reviewed its relevance, comprehensiveness, and comprehensibility. Based on their suggestions, we rephrased four questions and added multiple choice answer options for five questions. The final version of the survey included a total number of 46 ques- tions: eight questions about demographics, two about protocols for anesthesia practice, six about preoperative care, 26 about intraoperative care, two about postoperative care, and two about the respondent’s opinion on the adequacy of anesthetic care for patients with NEC in their center and ways it might be improved (Supplementary Table 1). The survey was distributed with help of the European Society for Pediatric Anesthesiology (ESPA) and several national (pediatric) anes- thesiology societies. To maximize the number of responses, societies in countries with a low response rate were requested to send reminders. The survey was open from June 12, 2023 until January 8, 2024. 2.3.

With regards to monitoring, the introduction of NIRS (n = 10) was most mentioned, followed by EEG (n = 4), end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) (n = 3), and thromboelastography (TEG) (n = 2). With regards to collaboration, thirteen respondents mentioned preoperative multidisciplinary team consultations and eight mentioned the need for better communication between anesthesiologists, neonatologists, and surgeons as suggestions for improvement. 4. Discussion This survey among 173 anesthesiologists across 31 European coun- tries identified a large variability in anesthetic care for preterm infants undergoing surgery for NEC, particularly in the chosen agents for anesthesia and their combinations.'),\n",

Intravenous anesthesia was most used for induction, while inhalation anesthesia was favored for main- tenance. For both induction and maintenance, the choice of technique strongly correlated with the location of surgery (OR vs. NICU). Propofol and midazolam were the preferred intravenous anesthetics for induction and maintenance, respectively, and sevoflurane the preferred inhalation anesthetic for either. Compared with the variety of anesthetics used, there was more consensus on the choices for analgesics and muscle re- laxants, with fentanyl and rocuronium being the most commonly used. Approximately a third of respondents used regional techniques intra- operatively and approximately a quarter postoperatively. Postoperative pain management mainly included paracetamol and/or morphine. The majority of respondents regarded current anesthetic care for patients with NEC in their center as adequate, but many ideas were shared for further improvement. These suggestions mostly revolved around enhanced monitoring, implementation of protocols, and improved collaboration.'),\n",

These suggestions mostly revolved around enhanced monitoring, implementation of protocols, and improved collaboration. To our knowledge, anesthetic care for patients undergoing surgery for NEC has not been studied on a European scale before. Two recent multicenter cohort studies, the APRICOT study and the NECTARINE study, have assessed anesthetic care for various surgical and nonsurgical procedures in the pediatric and neonatal population, respectively [8,10]. Similarly to our study, the APRICOT study found a large varia- tion in the used anesthetics, with sevoflurane and propofol being the most used inhalation and intravenous anesthetics for induction and fentanyl the most used analgesic [8]. The use of regional anesthesia in our study was also comparable with that reported in the APRICOT study and the NECTARINE study [10,11]. However, preterm infants with NEC may exhibit thrombocytopenia, which is a contraindication for neu- raxial analgesia techniques, possibly explaining the low reported use of epidural or caudal catheter techniques. A notable difference with the APRICOT study and the NECTARINE study was the far higher use of invasive blood pressure monitoring and NIRS in our study [8,10].'),\n",

This may be explained by differences in study population, with the APRICOT and NECTARINE study not only including critically ill children admitted to the intensive care unit but also ASA I-II children undergoing minor surgical procedures that require less intensive monitoring. The post- operative pain treatment observed in this study seems to resemble the pain treatment provided by neonatologists, which has been evaluated in a previous European survey [12]. This survey among neonatologists found that initial pain treatment for patients with NEC usually includes paracetamol, fentanyl and/or morphine, and that in case of persisting pain, pain treatment is intensified by increasing the dose of the administered opiate and/or adding agents such as midazolam, ketamine or dexmedetomidine [12]. The heterogeneity in anesthetic care for patients with NEC identified in this study may be explained by the lack of (international) guidelines.'),\n",

The heterogeneity in anesthetic care for patients with NEC identified in this study may be explained by the lack of (international) guidelines. Existing Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) consensus guidelines for perioperative care in neonatal intestinal surgery offer limited rec- ommendations regarding choice of anesthetics, and do not apply to preterm infants and infants with complex surgical conditions such as NEC [13]. Furthermore, this survey found that only a third of centers had written standard protocols for anesthesia in infants, and even fewer had specific protocols for patients with NEC. This lack of protocols is probably attributed to the paucity of evidence on this topic, with various anesthetics being used off-label [9]. Consequently, the anesthetic care provided to patients with NEC likely varies depending on the anesthe- siologist’s preferences, availability of medication in the center, and local habits. This practice variability highlights the lack of evidence on what is the most optimal anesthetic care for this patient group, although it may also reflect multiple treatments being equally effective [14]. Nonetheless, the implementation of protocols was frequently mentioned as an opportunity to improve anesthetic care for patients with NEC.'),\n",

The results of this survey may provide a first step towards developing a guideline for perioperative anesthetic care for preterm infants with NEC. Alternatively, individualized anesthetic plans could be developed ac- cording to the 10-Ns principle proposed by the SAFETOTS initiative, focusing on physiological targets rather than choice of anesthetics [15]. In addition to the implementation of protocols, respondents sug- gested collaboration within the surgical team as a target to improve anesthetic care for infants with NEC. Collaboration may be improved by performing preoperative multidisciplinary consultation, which four in five respondents of this survey reported doing structurally or occasion- ally. Additionally, this survey showed that preoperative evaluation is not always performed prior to surgery in patients with NEC, which may reflect the urgency of surgery in the most severely ill patients. The ERAS guidelines for neonatal intestinal surgery strongly recommend stan- dardized perioperative communication with multidisciplinary teams [13].'),\n",

The ERAS guidelines for neonatal intestinal surgery strongly recommend stan- dardized perioperative communication with multidisciplinary teams [13]. Preoperative briefings have been shown to improve team work and communication in the operating room and may thereby improve patient outcomes [16]. Respondents also frequently mentioned monitoring as an area for improvement, for instance through increased use of NIRS monitoring. NIRS is not part of standard intraoperative monitoring yet, but may be a valuable addition as it enables swifter detection of tissue hypoxia [17]. Moreover, in infants with (suspected) NEC, cerebral and splanchnic NIRS measurements may be used diagnostically or predictively [18]. In addition, respondents suggested incorporation of EEG to monitor depth of anesthesia. However, young infants often do not yet have differenti- ated EEGs, hampering the use of EEG-based monitoring devices [19]. Maintaining tissue perfusion in infants undergoing surgery is of the utmost importance, since impaired tissue oxygenation, indicated by the presence of hypotension, hypoxemia, and anemia, is associated with an'),\n",

In addition, the risk of morbidity and mortality is increased in the most preterm born infants and in those requiring intensive support prior to surgery [10]. These risk factors are all highly relevant for infants with NEC, who are often extremely preterm and require admission to a neonatal intensive care unit. Furthermore, infants with NEC are frequently hemodynamically unstable and exhibit impaired tissue oxygenation, both cerebrally and intestinally [21–24]. Given their he- modynamic instability, the high use of propofol observed in this study is surprising, as propofol may induce hypotension in critically ill neonates [25]. Anesthetic strategies for infants with NEC should focus on optimal analgosedation while safeguarding cerebral and intestinal perfusion, and anesthesia should be provided by an experienced pediatric anes- thesiologist to mitigate the risks of severe critical events [8,26]. Decreases in cerebral perfusion during surgery may contribute to the increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment in infants with sur- gical NEC [27,28].'),\n",

Other factors that may contribute to this increased risk include the greater disease severity and inflammation in infants with surgical NEC and possibly anesthetics-related neurotoxicity [29,30]. Studies in rodents have demonstrated that neonatal exposure to various anesthetics, including ketamine, midazolam, and inhalation anesthetics, causes neuronal apoptosis and cognitive impairment [31]. Human studies, on the other hand, have not identified clear neurotoxic effects of anesthesia in infants, although high quality and well-powered safety trials are generally missing, especially in preterm infants. While some observational studies suggest an association between neonatal anesthesia exposure and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes [32–38], a twin study and a sibling-matched cohort study (PANDA study) found no differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes between the exposed and unexposed sibling [39,40], suggesting an underlying vulnerability may confound the association between anesthesia and neurodevelopmental outcomes.'),\n",

However, these prospective studies did not involve critically ill, preterm infants. As shown in this survey, pediatric anesthesiologists remain cautious in patients with NEC, with over a third of the respondents of this survey avoiding certain anesthetics due to concerns about neurotoxicity. A strength of this study is that it addresses a previously unexplored topic in our most vulnerable patients, namely anesthesia practice for preterm infants with NEC, on a European scale.

Another limitation is that we did not specify the type of surgery for NEC, and therefore respondents may have had different types of surgery (e.g., laparotomy, peritoneal drainage) in mind while completing the questionnaire. This may have affected their responses. Furthermore, to limit the time burden of completing the questionnaire, no questions were included regarding the used anesthetic doses.

Patient blood management is a multimodal approach based on three pillars: optimization of blood mass, minimization of blood loss and optimization of patient tolerance to anaemia.

They represent an essential part of the pharmacological arsenal of patient blood management. However, despite the trend towards high-level PBM practices, currently very few European countries have national PBM guidelines and these guidelines, taken as a whole, are heterogeneous in form and content. In particular, the use of antifibrinolytics in cardiac surgery is often not discussed in detail beyond general pro- phylactic use and any recommendations lack detail including choice of drug, dosing, and mode of administration.

Introduction Cardiac surgery carries a high risk of peri-operative bleeding [1], as evidenced by the high proportion (50–60%) of cardiac surgical patients who require allogeneic blood transfusion during and after surgery [2,3]. The risk of bleeding in cardiac surgery is affected by numerous factors: invasiveness of the procedure; use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication; use of hypothermia; and use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) [1]. Several factors have been associated with an increased risk of bleeding such as advanced age, poor platelet function, preoperative anaemia, small body size, female sex, non-elective surgery, and repeat surgery [1]. Peri-operative bleeding has been shown to be an independent pre- dictor of hospital mortality. In a study including more than 9000 pa- tients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, massive blood loss (defined by the transfusion of at least five units of packed red blood cells on the day of surgery) was associated with an 8-fold increase in mortality [4]. Other studies have also reported excess morbidity, particularly in terms of thromboembolic complications, infections and higher rates of surgical re-exploration [5].'),\n",

Notably, surgical re-exploration and transfusion following bleeding are also associated with increased infection, mor- tality, and a longer stay in ICU and hospital [2,6]. Finally, excessive postoperative haemorrhage in cardiac surgery has a significant eco- nomic impact: a retrospective German analysis of more than 1100 pa- tients estimated its average additional cost to be €6251 per patient [7]. The concept of patient blood management (PBM), defined by the World Health Organization as a “patient-focused, evidence based and systematic approach for optimising the management of patients and transfusion of blood products to ensure high quality and effective patient care” [8] includes an anaesthetic, pharmacological and surgical approach. It is based on three pillars: optimization of blood mass, minimization of blood loss and optimization of patient tolerance to anaemia. In cardiac surgery, the use of antifibrinolytics is an essential component of the pharmacological approach in PBM and follows rec- ommendations from the European Association for Cardiothoracic Sur- gery (EACTS) and the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology (EACTA) [1].'),\n",

Fibrinolysis and heart surgery – antifibrinolytic treatments 2.1. Haemostatic disorders induced by cardiac surgery CPB used during cardiac surgery leads to activation of the coagula- tion system due to blood coming into contact with foreign surfaces such as plastic [9,10]. Thus, by the end of CPB, a significant proportion of coagulation factors will have been consumed; fibrinogen levels are decreased by approximately 40% [9] and platelets are activated, consumed and show a selective loss of alpha granules. In contrast, thrombin levels are elevated, which is not the case in other types of surgery [10]. Along with activating the generation of fibrin, thrombin is also an activator of fibrinolysis. Generally, fibrinolysis is a protective physiological response, pro- portionately inhibiting excess clot formation.'),\n",

However, after massive trauma, surgery, or with the use of CPB, local regulation of this response may be overwhelmed, so that the systemic and simultaneous production of thrombin and plasmin induces consumption coagulopathy, which prevents the formation of a stable clot, resulting in bleeding [11,12]. Fibrinolysis is also associated with impaired platelet function during and after CPB due to the action of plasmin and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) [11]. tPA is responsible for inhibition of platelet aggregation, and high plasmin levels can cause damage to platelets through cleavage of the GPIb receptor and triggering their partial activation, thus inducing a loss of responsiveness to further activation [13,14] (Fig. 1). Thus, fibrinolysis plays a major role in the pathophysiology of haemorrhage during cardiac surgery, as evidenced by the strong correlation of fibri- nolytic markers and the magnitude of blood loss after CPB [9,15]. 2.2. Antifibrinolytic treatment Antifibrinolytic drugs inhibit fibrinolysis and, when administered prophylactically, help prevent peri-operative bleeding [16,17].'),\n",

Commonly used antifibrinolytics include protease inhibitors (aprotinin) and lysine analogues (tranexamic acid (TXA) and ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA)). Aprotinin is a potent inhibitor of free plasmin which has a limited effect on physiological fibrinolysis [9,18]. Aprotinin is a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor, which also interacts with various other plasma pro- teases such as trypsin, kallikrein and elastase. Among the anti- fibrinolytics, it has the most potent activity [1,12]. It also has an anti- inflammatory effect decreasing systemic inflammation after CPB [19]. Lysine analogues are currently the most widely used anti- fibrinolytics. These synthetic derivatives of lysine inhibit fibrinolysis by preventing the formation of plasmin through their capacity to bind to plasminogen at the lysine binding site, thus preventing its binding to fibrin [11,18] (Fig. 2). The prophylactic administration of antifibrinolytics in surgery has been widely researched and discussed.'),\n",

Antifibrinolytics reduce peri and post-operative bleeding, transfusions, re-operations as well as morbidity, mortality, and associated costs, without increasing the inci- dence of acute graft thrombosis or thromboembolism [20]. Data suggest that aprotinin has an advantage over lysine analogues in reducing peri- and post-operative blood loss [21]. When trial results for the two lysine analogues were combined and compared with aprotinin alone, aprotinin was found to be slightly more effective in reducing the need for red blood cell transfusion. The data from 150 trials performed in cardiac surgery in more than 17,000 patients are consistent with these results [21] (Table 1). In 2008, aprotinin was withdrawn from the market following the publication of observational studies that reported an increased risk of adverse cardiological, neurological and renal events [9,22], as well as the preliminary results from a comparative, randomized, double-blind study (the BART trial), which raised suspicion of excess mortality linked to aprotinin [23].

Furthermore, a meta-analysis of data from 88 trials including over 15,000 patients found no increased risk of mortality associated with aprotinin compared with other antifibrinolytics [24]. In 2012, after re- evaluation of the data, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) concluded that: “the data from the BART study concerning excess mortality associated with aprotinin were not reliable” and lifted the suspension of aprotinin's marketing authorization, but restricted its indication to the prophylactic use in adult patients at high risk of major bleeding undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) sur- gery [25]. For the lysine analogues, attention has recently been drawn to the possible but rare occurrence of epileptic seizures [9]. A large retro- spective study of over 11,000 patients undergoing CPB reported an incidence of seizures of 0.9% in those treated with TXA. Patients with epileptic seizures had a 2.5 to 3-fold higher death rate, and hospital stay was twice as long. The administration of TXA has been shown to be an independent predictor of seizures, correlated with higher doses [26,27]. 3.\"),\n",

This guide is to be used as a tool setting the framework for national authorities to support the implementation and dissemination of PBM programs across Europe. At the European level, an update of the “Management of severe perioperative bleeding” guidelines was published in 2017 by the ESAIC [31]. These general PBM recommendations are not focused on cardiac surgery; nevertheless, the management of cardiac surgical patients is discussed. The recommendations are classified according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evalua- tion) system.

During the preoperative phase, the authors suggest a potential interest for point-of-care (POC) testing, which is meant to predict perioperative bleeding.

In the perioperative setting, treatment algorithms based on viscoelastic POC tests should be considered in order to reduce the number of transfusions for the bleeding patient (Class IIa – Level B). Antifibrinolytics (TXA, aprotinin or EACA) are recommended during the intraoperative period to reduce blood loss and the need for trans- fusion, and also to reduce the risk of reoperation for bleeding (TXA and aprotinin) (level of evidence 1A).

This publication summarizes the principles of PBM with the three- pillars-based approach and presents a series of recommendations for the implementation of PBM in France. It includes an international literature review, a multidisciplinary field survey and recommendations from the scientific committee to provide guidance on the implementa- tion of PBM programs. The field survey demonstrated that PBM as a formalized concept was not very well known by French practitioners. Regarding the use of antifibrinolytics, the authors recommended TXA (1 g) at anaesthetic induction and at the end of the surgical procedure (1 g). The authors considered that the topical application of TXA needs further research. It should serve as a basis for French guidelines on PBM, which are expected soon by the Haute Autorit´e de Sant´e (HAS) [33]. 3.3.2.'),\n",

Discussion In March 2011, the WHO held a “Global Forum on Blood Safety: Patient Blood Management” aimed at establishing a framework for the WHO Member States to actively support PBM dissemination and implementation [8]. Since then, PBM programs have been implemented in many countries around the world. In 2021, the WHO published a new document to highlight the urgent need to close the gap in PBM aware- ness and implementation and announced their upcoming initiative to develop PBM implementation guidelines [42]. At the European level, guidelines on bleeding management were published in 2017 by the ESAIC [31] and PBM guidelines specifically focussed on cardiac surgery were published in 2018 jointly by the EACTS and the EACTA [1].'),\n",

Furthermore, the implementation of PBM programs has been actively supported by the European Commission, in particular through guides intended for national health authorities and hospitals, meant to help EU member states make PBM a standard for improving the quality and safety of patient care. [29,30] However, while PBM practices are increasingly being used, national guidelines are still rare and very few are specific to cardiac surgery. All the current available guidelines follow and agree on the definition of PBM as defined by the WHO [8], supported by three pillars: optimizing blood volume, minimising blood loss and optimizing the patient's tolerance to anaemia. To decrease blood loss during cardiac surgery, European guidelines mention that the assessment of specific haemostasis parameters in the preoperative setting (such as fibrinogen level and platelet function for specific patients…) could be useful to predict perioperative bleeding and to decrease transfusion rates [1,43]. Anaemia is known to be a predictor of postoperative adverse out- comes for patients, so its management is the cornerstone of PBM.\"),\n",

Anaemia is known to be a predictor of postoperative adverse out- comes for patients, so its management is the cornerstone of PBM. Limiting blood loss during surgical procedures is also of paramount importance to reduce the use of blood products transfusions and limit the risk for reoperation for bleeding. In this context, the European and national PBM guidelines all recommend the prophylactic use of anti- fibrinolytics to avoid or reduce perioperative bleeding. However, they differ in the type of antifibrinolytic recommended, when it should be given and how (bolus or infusion or both), including the dose (Table 3). Most guidelines recommend only the use of tranexamic acid. Aprotinin is rarely mentioned, partly because of its recent reintroduction in Europe, and its continued non-availability on the market in some countries such as Italy. How Aprotinin should be given and when, as well as the dose and timing of administration are mostly not discussed (Table 4). National PBM guidelines for European countries therefore appear to be both few in number and heterogeneous. This situation could partly explain the marked discrepancies found in a recent survey of PBM practices in cardiac surgery across different European countries [44].'),\n",

In this survey, it appears that PBM programs are not universally or consistently implemented in European cardiac surgical centres, resulting in differences in patient's management for the same clinical situation. The survey highlights that, the differences observed in guidelines, including antifibrinolytic use, exist between countries at an interna- tional level and also at a national level with different protocols in in- dividual cardiac surgical centres within a specific country, and sometimes, different protocols within the same cardiac surgical centre. The situation is quite different in the United States and in Australia, where PBM practices are more widely implemented. The American So- ciety of Anesthesiologists (ASA) published its “Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management” in 2015 giving general recommen- dations for PBM [45]. However, although the use of antifibrinolytic therapy is mentioned to reduce blood loss and risk of transfusion for patient at high-risk of bleeding, or undergoing CPB, no detailed protocol is provided.\"),\n",

Australia appears to be one of the countries with the most compre- hensive “supply” of PBM literature. The National Blood Authority (NBA) administers a website dedicated to PBM, including extensive PBM guidelines (Critical bleeding/massive transfusion; Perioperative; Medi- cal; Critical care; Obstetrics and maternity; and Neonatal and paediat- rics). These PBM guidelines were published in 2012, and in 2019 a survey assessed how blood transfusions and patient outcomes in cardiac surgery changed after the guidelines were published [46]. The authors demonstrated that, thanks to the implementation of PBM guidelines, there was a significant reduction in intraoperative blood transfusions in'),\n",

All in all, European countries could benefit from the experience gained through these programs developed by other countries to improve, accelerate and deploy the implementation of PBM at a large scale.

Antifibrinolytics play a major role in cardiac surgery, where the risk of perioperative bleeding is high and affects a majority of patients, by effectively reducing bleeding, transfusions and re-operations, as well as their associated morbidity and mortality. They represent an essential part of the pharmacological arsenal of patient blood management. However, the use of these drugs in cardiac surgery in Europe is not covered in sufficient detail by national recommendations. This lack of common recommendations is partly due to the scarcity of available robust data. It would be of particular interest to set up comparative clinical studies with the major antifibrinolytics to determine the best protocols and dosages to use in practice and thus to homogenize prac- tice. To complement these trials, a network meta-analysis or a system- atic review of the evidence to date on antifibrinolytics in cardiac surgery and their effects on major patients' outcomes might be useful to generate important data to rely on for daily practices.\"),\n",

Additionally, the past few years have yielded new research that has shown significant inter- individual variation in gastric emptying regardless of the length of the fast, with some patients still having residual gastric contents even after prolonged fasts. Additionally, multiple large- scale studies have shown no long- term sequalae from clear fluid aspiration, although two deaths from aspiration have been reported within the large Wake Up Safe cohort. This has led to a change in the recommended clear fluid fasting times in multiple international pediatric societies; similarly, many societies continue to recommend traditional fasting times. Multiple fasting strategies exist in the literature, though these have mostly been stud- ied and implemented in the adult population. This review hopes to summarize the recent updates in fasting guidelines, discuss the issues surrounding prolonged fasting, and explore potential tolerance strategies for children.

This may be particularly distressing for young children and lead to a range of negative psycho- social as well as physiological outcomes.1– 8 Fasting before general anesthesia re- duces the volume of gastric contents in an effort to reduce the risk of gastric regurgitation and the consequences of any pulmonary as- piration.1 “Fasting from midnight” made its appearance in the 1970s, after multiple case reports in adults of pulmonary aspiration dur- ing anesthesia.1 This dogma was subsequently adopted around the world, in both the adult and pediatric populations, as common prac- tice. While pulmonary aspiration is the commonest cause of death during anesthesia in adults,9 to date there have been very few pedi- atric deaths, or long- term sequalae, reported from aspiration in the pediatric population.10– 12 In recent times, there have been considerable efforts to find a better balance between sufficient fasting times to avoid aspiration, while simultaneously reducing the negative physiological outcomes and stress on our young patients.'),\n",

The scope of this review is to explore the updates in recent fasting guidelines and examine the adverse effects of prolonged fasting in children and the proposed solutions. Pediatric fasting guidelines are typically divided into clear fluids, breast milk, formula, and solids. Clear fluids have been defined by the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) as “water, carbohydrate rich fluids, specifically developed for periop- erative use, pulp free fruit juice, clear cordial, black tea and coffee … excludes fluids containing particulate matter, soluble fibre, milk- based drinks and jelly.”15 Internationally, solids have also been fur- ther divided into light breakfasts (specified as “buttered toast with jam or cereals with milk”16) and solids (other foods not previously included).17 The pediatric fasting guidelines have recently been updated in multiple countries (Table 1) to reflect the latest evidence for gastric emptying, and the minimal morbidity and mortality data reflected in pediatric patients who do aspirate.'),\n",

Dennhardt et al.7 encouraged and educated ward staff and par- ents to allow children to eat until pre- specified times, as well as in- troducing ongoing communication with theaters to better predict the patient's time to surgery. They also allowed children clear fluids in the morning, unless they were scheduled as the first case, with both active verbal and written reminders and encouragement.7 They compared this with the results from their previous study where chil- dren had the same fasting times (6\\u2009h for solids, 4\\u2009h for breast milk or formula, and 2\\u2009h for clear fluids), but only had standard written instructions.7 In this way, they were able to demonstrate a decrease in prolonged fasting (mean 6 vs 8.5\\u2009h), lower ketone body concen- trations (mean 0.2 vs 0.8\\u2009mmol/L), more stable hemodynamics, and improved comfort.7 This strategy could easily be replicated in most institutions, through providing information and responding to ongo- ing updates, though it may increase staff workload.

      "\n",
      "3. **페리코로믹 관리 프로토콜**: 각 DOA의 약동학적 특성에 기반한 항응고제 중단 및 재개 프로토콜의 중요성을 강조하며, 특히 수술 전 항응고제 중단 후 신경 차단 시술까지의 적절한 대기 시간을 제안합니다.\n",
