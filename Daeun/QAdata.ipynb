Because preoperative\\nanxiety can complicate the induction of anesthesia and develop\\nnegative postoperative behavior [1,2], pediatric anesthesiologists\\ngenerally use a variety of interventions to reduce preoperative\\nanxiety in children. Surveys conducted in different countries\\nhave documented the frequencies of and the reasons for\\nanxiolytic interventions in pediatric patients [3-7]. However, no\\nsuch study has been previously conducted in Korea. In\\naddition, practices have changed over decades due to the\\nintroductions of short-acting anesthetics with fewer side effects,\\nadvances in distraction technology, and the increasing trend\\ntoward parental presence during induction of anesthesia (PPIA).\\nThe aims of this study were to document current practice\\nand general opinions regarding pharmacological and non-phar-\\nmacological interventions for alleviating preoperative anxiety in\\nchildren about to undergo general anesthesia in Korea.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nAn approval was obtained from our hospital Institutional\\nReview Board for this study.

Small\\nproportion of respondents (14.6%) stated they had no preference.\\nThe three most common reasons given to support preference\\nwere effectiveness (32.0%), concern about side effects (26.0%),\\nand convenience (24.0%, Table 3). However, these reasons\\nwere found to depend on anxiolytic preferences, that is, effec-\\ntiveness was favored by those who preferred pharmacological\\nintervention, and concern about side effects was favored by\\nthose who preferred non-pharmacological intervention.\\nActually used intervention for reducing anxiety in clinical\\npractice were significantly different according to the anxiolytic\\npreference (P = 0.005) but they did not consistently match\\neach other (Table 4). Overall, non-pharmacological intervention\\nand premedication were actually performed by 36.6 and 24.4%\\nof the respondents, respectively, in clinical practice. Both were\\nused by 29.3% and neither was used by 9.8% of the\\nrespondents.\\nCurrent practice and general opinions regarding\\npharmacological anxiolytic intervention in pediatric\\npatients\\nAbout half of the respondents (53.7%) reported use of\\npremedication prior to surgery as single intervention or\\ncombination with non-pharmacological intervention. However,\\nthe other respondents (46.3%) stated they were unlikely to use\\npremedication in practice because of needlessness of premedication\\n(42.1%), concern about side effects (31.5%) and invasiveness\\nof administration (21.5%).\\nReducing child anxiety (63.4%) and control of sympathetic\\nactivity (17.1%) were reported to be the two most important\\nreasons for premedication. Reducing parental anxiety, pain\\ncontrol, and improving cooperation during induction of\\nanesthesia tied as the third most important reasons (each\\n9.8%). Age limitation to premedication was applied by 39.0%\\nof respondents. Although minimum age for premedication\\nranged from 1 month to 5 years, majority of respondents\\n(68.8%) adopted a minimum age of 1 year.\\nDrug selection for premedication was guided by customarily\\nuse (45.1%), the literature (17.1%), and effectiveness (14.6%).\\nTable 3.

We found that the strategies used to reduce\\nchild anxiety were determined by an informally standardized\\nhospital protocol or individual experience rather than a written\\npolicy. In contrast, 72% of US hospitals have a formal policy\\nfor premedication [3]. Without current best evidence, preoperative\\nanxiolytic intervention based on hospital protocol may become\\ndated, to the detriment of patients. In our opinion, decision\\nmaking should be guided by formal policy integrated with\\nindividual clinical expertise and best available scientific\\nevidence to ensure children are provided with the most\\neffective and safe anxiolytic intervention.\\nAlthough many non-pharmacological interventions have been\\nreported to be as effective as sedative premedication [8],\\nrespondents who wanted effective anxiolysis preferred phar-\\nmacological intervention, while those who wanted safe anxiolysis\\npreferred non-pharmacological intervention. Our finding implies\\nthat anxiolytic intervention preference of pediatric anesthesiologists\\nwas usually determined by customarily established protocol or\\nhabitual choice rather than scientific research. And it also\\nexplains why actually used interventions did not consistently\\nmatch with preferred interventions. The two most important\\npurposes of premedication are to reduce anxiety and sympathetic\\nactivity during induction of anesthesia. In Korea, the sedative\\npremedication rate for pediatric anesthesia (54.7%), as determined\\nby the present study, is similar to those reported in Turkey,\\nGermany, and the United States [5,9,10], but is much higher\\nthan reported in the United Kingdom for day-case surgery\\n(19%) [7]. Although numerous drugs have been used in\\nclinical practice, midazolam is currently the mainstay of\\nsedative premedication for pediatric anesthesia. Its long history\\nof safety, effectiveness, and minimal delay to discharge from\\npost-anesthesia care unit well explain its global use in clinical\\npractice. Because oral or intranasal midazolam, commonly used\\nas a premedication in Europe and the US [5,9], is not\\ncurrently available in Korea, respondents mostly administered\\nmidazolam intravenously in the preoperative holding area.\\nThe routine use of anticholinergic agents prior to anesthesia\\nand surgery now shows a declining tread, because of its\\nadverse effects, such as, an uncomfortable dryness of mouth,\\nand the introduction of less irritating anesthetics [11,12]. In the\\npresent study, respondents premedicated anticholinergic agents\\n(glycopyrrolate and less frequently atropine) based on clinical\\nrequirements rather than routine use and principally admi-\\nnistered via an intravenous route immediately before anesthesia,\\nwhich is similar to European and Australian practice [5,12,13].\\nRespiratory depression was the most commonly experienced\\nside effect of premedication, and was the main reason for\\navoiding sedative premedication in children and for administering\\npremedication in preoperative holding areas equipped with\\nsufficient resources to monitor and manage side effects rather\\nthan in ward. We presume that fear for respiratory depression\\n(the most serious side effect of premedication) caused the\\nmajority of respondents to forbid the premedication of children\\nless than 1 year old.\\nNearly half of the respondents preferred non-pharmacological\\nintervention, which was also the most commonly used type of\\nintervention in clinical practice. PPIA was the most frequently\\nemployed non-pharmacological intervention by respondents.\\nAlthough the large Cochrane review conducted by Yip et al.\\n[8] concluded that PPIA did not reduce preoperative anxiety or\\nimprove cooperation during induction of anesthesia, the majority\\nof our respondents believed PPIA is the most effective\\nnon-pharmacological anxiolytic intervention. In our survey,\\n78.0% of respondents agree with PPIA and 19.5% allowed\\nroutine PPIA. On the other hand, 50% of American anes-\\nthesiologists forbade PPIA [9], and most anesthesiologists in\\nthe UK and Canada allowed PPIA [14-16]. Discrepancies\\nbetween countries may be due to the use of different induction\\ntechniques, legal implications, and economic issues, such as,\\noperating room efficiency.\\nThis study has several limitations that bear consideration.\\nFirst, the response rate was only 26%, and thus, we cannot\\nclaim our survey accurately reflects anxiolytic practices used\\nby Korean anesthesiologists in pediatric patients. Accordingly,\\nwe suggest a larger-scale study be initiated to confirm and\\nsupplement our findings in all anesthesiologists currently worked\\nin Korea. Second, we did not investigate the use of anxiolytic\\nintervention by patient age or hospital stay after surgery, which\\ncould significantly affect decision making.\\nSummarizing, pediatric anesthesiologists in Korea use both\\npharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions based\\non informally standardized hospital protocols to reduce child\\nanxiety prior to surgery. Those requiring the effective reduction\\nof anxiety were found to prefer pharmacological intervention\\nand to favor the use intravenous midazolam, whereas those'),\n",
