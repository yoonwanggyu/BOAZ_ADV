     Transfusion-related hyperkalemic cardiac arrest (TRHCA) is a\nserious complication of administration of packed red blood cell\n(P-RBC). We present a case of repeated TRHCAs in a 13\nmonth-old girl, who was undergoing intra-abdominal huge mass\nexcision. There were three consecutive TRHCAs during the\noperation. The first (11.7 mM of KT) and the second (9.5 mM of\nK+) cardiac arrests were successfully resuscitated. However, the\nlast cardiac arrest (8.9 mM of K+) was failed to be recovered with\nconventional treatment. Risk factors of TRHCA such as hypo-\ncalcemia, hypoxemia, acidosis, hyperglycemia, hyperlactatemia, and\nlow cardiac out state were combined. The transfused P-RBCs\nwere all irradiated. In this situation, processing of P-RBC using\nan autotransfusion device before the transfusion should be consi-\ndered to prevent hyperkalemia in addition to conventional treatment\nof TRHCA. (Anesth Pain Med 2009; 4: 179~182)\n\nKey Words: cardiac arrest, hyperkalemia, transfusion.\n\nAmong cardiovascular causes of cardiac arrest, hypovolemia\nfrom blood loss and hyperkalemia from transfusion of stored\n1) Occurrence of\nblood are the most common identifiable causes.\ntransfusion-related hyperkalemic cardiac arrest (TRHCA) is\naffected by the potassium concentration in packed red blood\ncell (P-RBC), the rate of transfusion, and the amount of\nvenous return to the heart. If massive bleeding continues\nduring operation, even though transfusion-related complication\nsuch as hyperkalemia is manifested, it is difficult to make a\ndecision whether transfusion should be continued or not. In\nthis situation the method to prevent the TRHCA during massive transfusion should be considered. We report a case of\nrepeated TRHCAs during massive bleeding and transfusion in a\npediatric patient.\n\n# CASE REPORT\n\nA 13-month-old female was scheduled for elective excision\nof huge malignant transformed teratoma. No significant abnor-\nmality except a 1 mm sized ventricular septal defect was\ndetected in preoperative assessment. Preoperative hemoglobin\nconcentration was 11.8 g/dl. Her weight was 9.9 kg giving an\nestimated blood volume of 800 ml.\n\nAnesthesia was induced with 60 mg of thiopental IV at 1\n4 : 05. Mask ventilation was performed with sevoflurane 8\nvol% in 100% oxygen and 6 mg of rocuronium was injected\nfor muscle relaxation. After confirming muscle relaxation, the\ntrachea was intubated orally with a I.D. 4.0 mm plain\nendotracheal tube. A 22 gauge catheter was placed in the right\nradial artery for continuous blood pressure monitoring and\nsampling. An esophageal stethoscope was inserted to monitor\ntemperature and to check a cardiac and respiratory sound.\nCentral venous catheter was inserted through the right subclavian\nvein for monitoring of the central venous pressure and the\nfluid management. ABGA was performed after induction (14 :\n57, F1O2 0.5, pH 7.42, PaCO2 35 mmHg, PaO2 148 mmHg,\nSodium 137 mM, Potassium 3.9 mM, ionized calcium 1.18\nmM, Hct 29%, Glucose 111 mg/dl, Lactate 0.8 mM).\n\nAnesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (2-3 vol%) and\nintermittent fentanyl injection (total 100 ï¿½g). Forced air warmer\nTM\n(Bair Hugger warming unit, Arizant Healthcare Inc., USA),\nfluid warming device (HotlineTM fluid warmer, SIMS level 1\nInc., USA) and warming branketrol (BranketrolIITM, CSZ pro-\nducts Inc., USA) were used to prevent hypothermia. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate remained stable for the\nfirst 1.5 hours of surgery. During that period, estimated blood\nloss was about 300 ml, and 200 ml of Lactated Ringer's\nsolution, 30 ml of HES (VoluvenTM, Fresenius Kabi, Germany)\nand 1 unit of P-RBC were infused continuously. Calcium\nchloride 30 mg was administered through central venous catheter\nfor fear of transfusion related-hypocalcemia (16 : 10, F1O2 0.5,\npH 7.37, PaCO2 34 mmHg, PaO2 138 mmHg, Sodium 135\nmM, Potassium 5.3 mM, ionized calcium 1.17 mM, Hct 27%,\nGlucose 135 g/dl, Lactate 1.2 mM).\n\nTwenty minutes after the second P-RBC was connected to\nthe central venous line, massive bleeding was observed in the\noperative field and blood pressure abruptly decreased. Simul-\ntaneously 10 ml of P-RBC was injected through central venous\ncatheter. Immediately after injection of P-RBC, cardiac rhythm\nwas suddenly changed into asystole at 16 : 25. External cardiac\ncompression was started and epinephrine 50 ug was injected.\nABGA and electrolyte measurement were performed (16 : 30,\nF1O2 1.0, pH 7.55, PaCO2 35 mmHg, PaO2 354 mmHg, Sodium\n150 mM, Potassium 11.7 mM, ionized calcium 0.65 mM, Hct\n25%, Glucose 149 mg/dl, Lactate 7.5 mM). In suspicion of the\ntransfusion related hyperkalemia, the potassium level of the\ntransfused P-RBC was also checked but the potassium concen-\ntration of P-RBC was immeasurable. Calcium chloride 60 mg\nand epinephrine 30 ug were injected additionally and sodium\nbicarbonate 10 mEq was also administered intravenously. For\nthe treatment of hyperkalemia, 1.5 units of insulin and lasix 5\nmg were injected intravenously. Ten minutes after the cardiac\narrest, sinus rhythm was returned and ABGA was done (16 :\n36, FIO2 1.0, pH 7.03, PaCO2 52 mmHg, PaO2 373 mmHg,\nSodium 137 mM, Potassium 6.5 mM, ionized calcium 1.53\nmM, Hct 29%, Glucose 287 mg/dl, Lactate 8.4 mM).\nFollowing the recovery from the cardiac arrest, massive bleeding\nrestarted. In consequence, transfusion was started with different\nP-RBC. At 16:45 cardiac rhythm changed into asystole again\nand cardiac massage was initiated (16 : 50, FIO2 1.0, pH 7.34,\nPaCO2 29 mmHg, PaO2 365 mmHg, Sodium 141 mM, Pota-\nssium 9.5 mM, ionized calcium 0.31 mM, Hct 27%, Glucose\n259 mg/dl, Lactate 8.3 mM). Epinephrine 50 ug and calcium\nchloride 120 mg were injected. Insulin 1 unit and sodium\nbicarbonate 20 mEq were administered. When asystole changed\ninto ventricular tachycardia at 16 : 54, the heart was defibrillated\nwith 20 J and sinus rhythm was returned. Dopamine 5 ug\nkg/min was infused and 100 ml of 50% dextrose solution\nmixed with 20 unit insulin was infused at 10 ml/h (17 : 02,\nF1O2 1.0, pH 7.17, PaCO2 67 mmHg, PaO2 127 mmHg,\n\nSodium 144 mM, Potassium 6.1 mM, ionized calcium 0.90\nmM, Hct 40%, Glucose 292 mg/dl, Lactate 8.5 mM).\n\nThereafter, massive bleeding continued again and large amounts\nof blood products and crystalloid were administered. Coagu-\nlation lab and ABGA at 17 : 36 were as follow: 112 sec of\naPTT (ref 29-45), 1.83 INR of PT (ref 0.8-1.2) and 113\nmg/dl of fibrinogen (ref 170-350) (17 : 36, FIO2 0.6, pH\n7.54, PaCO2 32 mmHg, PaO2 203 mmHg, Sodium 143 mM,\nPotassium 4.8 mM, ionized calcium 0.38 mM, Hct 20%, Glucose\n319 mg/dl, Lactate 5.5 mM). At 17:51 ventricular fibrillation\nreappeared and changed into asystole again (17 : 55, F1O2 1.0,\npH 7.26, PaCO2 36 mmHg, PaO2 130 mmHg, Sodium 141\nmM, Potassium 8.9 mM, ionized calcium 0.82 mM, Hct 34%,\nGlucose 291 mg/dl, Lactate 4.4 mM). Cardiopulmonary resusci-\ntation and treatment for hyperkalemia were continued but\ncardiac rhythm was not restored (18 : 03, F1O2 1.0, pH 7.30,\nPaCO2 41 mmHg, PaO2 40 mmHg, Sodium 148 mM, Potassium\n10.6 mM, ionized calcium 0.1 mM, Hct 28%, Glucose 356\nmg/dl, Lactate 6.8 mM). Hypoxemia and acidosis were not\neasily corrected and hyperglycemia, hyperlactatemia and hypo-\ncalcemia were combined (18 : 14, F1O2 1.0, pH 7.09, PaCO2\n50 mmHg, PaO2 32 mmHg, Sodium 146 mM, Potassium 6.8\nmM, ionized calcium 0.13 mM, Hct 22%, Glucose 367 mg/dl,\nLactate 7.8 mM). Although sinus rhythm was returned at 19 :\n00 (19 : 03, FIO2 1.0, pH 6.80, PaCO2 88 mmHg, PaO2 76\nmmHg, Sodium 150 mM, Potassium 5.1 mM, ionized calcium\n0.61 mM, Hct 25%, Glucose 500 mg/dl, Lactate 15 mM),\nasystole reappeared at 19 : 08 (19 : 16, FIO2 1.0, pH 7.04,\nPaCO2 56 mmHg, PaO2 42 mmHg, Sodium 151 mM,\nPotassium 7.9 mM, ionized calcium 0.1 mM, Hct 21%, Glucose\n439 mg/dl, Lactate 12.4 mM). Sinus rhythm was returned at\n19 : 30 but asystole reappeared at 19 : 32. The surgeon\ndecided to stop mass excision and bleeding control (19 : 53,\nF1O2 1.0, pH 6.80, PaCO2 47 mmHg, PaO2 60 mmHg, Sodium\n145 mM, Potassium 10.0 mM, ionized calcium 0.18 mM, Hct\n30%, Glucose 289 mg/dl, Lactate 12.6 mM). Patient was\ntransferred to ICU at 20:10 and expired at the ICU.\n\nEstimated blood loss was approximately 8,000 ml and urine\noutput was 220 ml during operation. Infused fluids consisted\nof Lactated Ringer's solution 200 ml, HES 500 ml, normal\nsaline 2,000 ml, P-RBC 19 units, fresh frozen plasma 12 units,\nplatelet concentrate 4 units, and cryoprecipitate 4 units. During\nthe operation, normothermia was maintained.\n\n DISCUSSION\n\nThere are a few cases of TRHCA which were successfully\nresuscitated in adults and children. 2-4) Recently, Smith et al.\nreported the inhospital survival rate of TRHCA was 12.5%. 5)\nIn our case, massive bleeding-induced hypovolemia and trans-\nfusion-related hyperkalemia caused successive cardiac arrests\nrefractory to treatment.\n\nThe first two cardiac arrests seemed to be mainly due to\ntransfusion-induced hyperkalemia and easily recovered by car-\ndiopulmonary resuscitation and conventional treatment for\nhyperkalemia. However, the third one was difficult to be resus-\ncitated because profound hypovolemia, low cardiac output,\nhypoxemia, acidosis, and hypocalcemia were combined. In\naddition, cardiopulmonary function might have been deteriorated\nby myocardial insult and pulmonary edema from the previous\ncardiac arrests.\n\nHyperkalemia may follow the transfusion of 'stored' RBCs\nand/or hemolysed units, and its clinical significance depends on\nthe quantity and the rate of transfusion. The extracellular\npotassium concentration in P-RBC is clinically important and\nmay give rise to hyperkalemia during massive blood trans-\nfusion. 6) In addition, the amount of venous return to the heart\nis an important factor of hyperkalemic cardiac arrest as well,\nespecially P-RBC was administered through central venous\ncatheter. The combination of rapid transfusion of hyperkalemic\nP-RBC and a low cardiac output state could cause life-threatening\nhyperkalemia. Rapid transfusion to a hypovolemic child with a\nIf\nlow venous return could be an explanation of TRHCA. 7)\nthere was no venous return from inferior vena cava due to\nmassive bleeding, the venous return to heart is only originated\nfrom superior vena cava containing rapidly infused P-RBC via\ncentral venous catheter. Relative amount of transfusion to venous\nreturn influences on potassium concentration in the coronary\nartery especially in small children. 2) Therefore, just small amount\nof injection of P-RBC can cause TRHCA in small children\nwhose venous return is reduced.\n\nEven 'fresh', less than 7 days stored, nonhemolysed P-RBC\ncan cause TRHCA in a pediatric patient. 8) Therefore, to\nprevent TRHCA, P-RBC should be as fresh as possible.\nFurthermore, the time between irradiation and transfusion\nshould be minimized.\n\nThis case reminded us once again the importance and\nnecessity of the use of potassium-low blood component (fresh,\nsaline-washed RBCs) in case of massive and rapid blood transfusion especially in pediatric patients with hypovolemia\nand low cardiac output. In our case, normothermia was main-\ntained during the operation. However, hypothermia can exacerbate\nthe tendency to arrhythmia in this situation. In addition,\nhypothermia aggravates the hypocalcemic toxicity by delaying\nthe metabolism of citrate. Therefore, temperature should be\ncontrolled well during the TRHCA.\n\nVenoveno bypass combined with hemoconcentration was used\nto prevent life-threatening hyperkalemia during liver trans-\nplantation in a patient with end-stage liver disease. 9) Although\ncardiopulmonary bypass could be considered in TRHCA, it\nmay be impractical because it is difficult to be prepared and\ntime consuming. Intraoperative autotransfusion device (Cell\nSaverTM Haemonetics, USA) or the continuous autotransfusion\n,\nsystem (C.A.T.STM, Fresenius Kabi, Germany) are effective in\nreducing potassium load. 10,11) This approach could be useful in\npatients undergoing hyperkalemia associated with massive\ntransfusion like our case. If massive bleeding is continued, the\ntransfusion can be inevitable. In our opinion, processing P-RBC\nwith intraoperative autotransfusion device could be an impor-\ntant method to prevent recurrent TRHCA in our case.\n\nIn conclusion, when massive transfusion is anticipated in\npediatric patients, P-RBC should be as fresh as possible and\nthe benefit and risk of irradiation should be considered. When\ntransfusion-related hyperkalemia occur during massive bleeding\nand transfusion, the intraoperative autotransfusion device should\nbe considered. Finally, a close monitoring, prompt recognition\nand aggressive treatment of hyperkalemia are important.
