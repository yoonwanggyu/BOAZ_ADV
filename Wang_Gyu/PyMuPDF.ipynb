Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics are not influenced to a clinically meaningful extent by body weight, age, or gender, which\\ncollectively indicate that these direct OACs can be given as\\nfixed dosing regimens without the need for routine coagulation\\nmonitoring [16–20]. The routes of drug elimination differ between the 2 drug classes: apixaban and rivaroxaban have multiple pathways including renal excretion (~27% and 66%',\n",
       " '[33% as active drug and 33% after metabolic degradation], respectively), whereas elimination of dabigatran is predominantly via the renal system (85%) [6,8,10,21]. In patients receiving\\ndabigatran for the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replacement surgery, a dose reduction is required in those with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL min[−][1]),\\nthose aged 75 years or over, and those taking concomitant\\nmild-to-moderate P-glycoprotein inhibitors [8]. Owing to their\\nmode of action, all anticoagulants can increase the risk of\\nbleeding events. However, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran did not pose any significantly increased risk of major\\nbleeding events compared with enoxaparin in phase III clinical\\ntrials in the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replacement\\nsurgery [22–30]. Despite the clinical evidence on the safety\\nand efficacy profile of direct OACs demonstrated in clinical trials,\\nphysicians—particularly anesthesiologists—need to be aware of\\nhow to minimize the risks of bleeding complications when treating patients who are taking an anticoagulant and are due to undergo surgery with regional anesthesia.\\nRegional anesthesia techniques have become increasingly popular because they offer several benefits over general anesthesia and\\ntraditional systemic analgesia, including reduced risk of mortality\\nand less postoperative pain, thus facilitating early postoperative\\nmobilization of the limbs and consequently reducing the chances\\nof postoperative VTE [31,32]. Regional anesthesia is used in\\nmillions of operations each year and, at a time when the use\\nof the direct OACs is growing, bleeding-related complications\\ncould arise if appropriate guidance is not followed [33]. This\\nreview aims to provide anesthesiologists with an overview of\\ncurrent data on the risk of hemorrhagic complications with\\ndirect OACs when using regional anesthesia, particularly\\nin patients at a high risk of VTE, such as those undergoing\\nmajor orthopedic surgery.
