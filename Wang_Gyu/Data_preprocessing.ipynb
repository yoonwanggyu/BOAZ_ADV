In Europe,<br>rivaroxaban is also indicated for co-administration with acetyl-<br>salicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or<br>ticlopidine for the prevention of atherothrombotic events after<br>acute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers<br>[10]. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct inhibitors of Factor<br>Xa, whereas dabigatran is a direct inhibitor of thrombin.<br>All three agents have been found to exhibit predictable<br>pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and have a fast<br>onset of action—reaching maximum plasma concentration<br>rapidly after oral administration (apixaban, 3-4 hours; rivarox-<br>aban, 2-4 hours; dabigatran, 0.5-2.0 hours) [6,8,10,12–15].<br>The half-lives of apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran are<br>~ 12 hours, 5-13 hours, and 11-14 hours, respectively<br>[6,8,10]. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacody-<br>namic characteristics are not inﬂuenced to a clinically mean-<br>ingful extent by body weight, age, or gender, which<br>collectively indicate that these direct OACs can be given as<br>ﬁxed dosing regimens without the need for routine coagulation<br>monitoring [16–20]. The routes of drug elimination differ be-<br>tween the 2 drug classes: apixaban and rivaroxaban have mul-<br>tiple pathways including renal excretion (~ 27% and 66%<br>[33% as active drug and 33% after metabolic degradation], re-<br>spectively), whereas elimination of dabigatran is predominant-<br>ly via the renal system (85%) [6,8,10,21]. In patients receiving<br>dabigatran for the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replace-<br>ment surgery, a dose reduction is required in those with mod-<br>erate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL min−1),<br>those aged 75 years or over, and those taking concomitant<br>mild-to-moderate P-glycoprotein inhibitors [8]. Owing to their<br>mode of action, all anticoagulants can increase the risk of<br>bleeding events. However, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabiga-<br>tran did not pose any signiﬁcantly increased risk of major<br>bleeding events compared with enoxaparin in phase III clinical<br>trials in the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replacement<br>surgery [22–30]. Despite the clinical evidence on the safety<br>and efﬁcacy proﬁle of direct OACs demonstrated in clinical trials,<br>physicians—particularly anesthesiologists—need to be aware of<br>how to minimize the risks of bleeding complications when treat-<br>ing patients who are taking an anticoagulant and are due to under-<br>go surgery with regional anesthesia.</p>\",\n",

Apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct inhibitors of Factor\\nXa, whereas dabigatran is a direct inhibitor of thrombin.\\nAll three agents have been found to exhibit predictable\\npharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and have a fast\\nonset of action—reaching maximum plasma concentration\\nrapidly after oral administration (apixaban, 3-4 hours; rivarox-\\naban, 2-4 hours; dabigatran, 0.5-2.0 hours) [6,8,10,12–15].\\nThe half-lives of apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran are\\n~ 12 hours, 5-13 hours, and 11-14 hours, respectively\\n[6,8,10]. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacody-\\nnamic characteristics are not inﬂuenced to a clinically mean-\\ningful extent by body weight, age, or gender, which\\ncollectively indicate that these direct OACs can be given as\\nﬁxed dosing regimens without the need for routine coagulation\\nmonitoring [16–20]. The routes of drug elimination differ be-\\ntween the 2 drug classes: apixaban and rivaroxaban have mul-\\ntiple pathways including renal excretion (~ 27% and 66%\\n[33% as active drug and 33% after metabolic degradation], re-\\nspectively), whereas elimination of dabigatran is predominant-\\nly via the renal system (85%) [6,8,10,21]. In patients receiving\\ndabigatran for the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replace-\\nment surgery, a dose reduction is required in those with mod-\\nerate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL min−1),\\nthose aged 75 years or over, and those taking concomitant\\nmild-to-moderate P-glycoprotein inhibitors [8]. Owing to their\\nmode of action, all anticoagulants can increase the risk of\\nbleeding events. However, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabiga-\\ntran did not pose any signiﬁcantly increased risk of major\\nbleeding events compared with enoxaparin in phase III clinical\\ntrials in the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replacement\\nsurgery [22–30]. Despite the clinical evidence on the safety\\nand efﬁcacy proﬁle of direct OACs demonstrated in clinical trials,\\nphysicians—particularly anesthesiologists—need to be aware of\\nhow to minimize the risks of bleeding complications when treat-\\ning patients who are taking an anticoagulant and are due to under-\\ngo surgery with regional anesthesia.'},\n",

Utilization of regional neuraxial anesthesia in patients receiving anticoagulants carries<br>a relatively small risk of hematoma, the serious complications of which must be acknowledged. Given<br>the extensive use of regional anesthesia in surgery and the increasing number of patients receiving direct oral<br>anticoagulants, it is crucial to understand the current clinical data on the risk of hemorrhagic complications in<br>this setting, particularly for anesthesiologists. We discuss current data, guideline recommendations, and best<br>practice advice on effective management of the direct oral anticoagulants and regional anesthesia, including<br>in speciﬁc clinical situations, such as patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery at high risk of a thromboembolic<br>event, or patients with renal impairment at an increased risk of bleeding.<br>© 2016 The Authors.

In Europe,<br>rivaroxaban is also indicated for co-administration with acetyl-<br>salicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or<br>ticlopidine for the prevention of atherothrombotic events after<br>acute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers<br>[10]. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct inhibitors of Factor<br>Xa, whereas dabigatran is a direct inhibitor of thrombin.<br>All three agents have been found to exhibit predictable<br>pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and have a fast<br>onset of action—reaching maximum plasma concentration<br>rapidly after oral administration (apixaban, 3-4 hours; rivarox-<br>aban, 2-4 hours; dabigatran, 0.5-2.0 hours) [6,8,10,12–15].<br>The half-lives of apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran are<br>~ 12 hours, 5-13 hours, and 11-14 hours, respectively<br>[6,8,10]. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacody-<br>namic characteristics are not inﬂuenced to a clinically mean-<br>ingful extent by body weight, age, or gender, which<br>collectively indicate that these direct OACs can be given as<br>ﬁxed dosing regimens without the need for routine coagulation<br>monitoring [16–20]. The routes of drug elimination differ be-<br>tween the 2 drug classes: apixaban and rivaroxaban have mul-<br>tiple pathways including renal excretion (~ 27% and 66%<br>[33% as active drug and 33% after metabolic degradation], re-<br>spectively), whereas elimination of dabigatran is predominant-<br>ly via the renal system (85%) [6,8,10,21]. In patients receiving<br>dabigatran for the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replace-<br>ment surgery, a dose reduction is required in those with mod-<br>erate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL min−1),<br>those aged 75 years or over, and those taking concomitant<br>mild-to-moderate P-glycoprotein inhibitors [8]. Owing to their<br>mode of action, all anticoagulants can increase the risk of<br>bleeding events. However, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabiga-<br>tran did not pose any signiﬁcantly increased risk of major<br>bleeding events compared with enoxaparin in phase III clinical<br>trials in the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replacement<br>surgery [22–30]. Despite the clinical evidence on the safety<br>and efﬁcacy proﬁle of direct OACs demonstrated in clinical trials,<br>physicians—particularly anesthesiologists—need to be aware of<br>how to minimize the risks of bleeding complications when treat-<br>ing patients who are taking an anticoagulant and are due to under-<br>go surgery with regional anesthesia.</p>\\n<br><p id=\\'19\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:14px\\'>Regional anesthesia techniques have become increasingly pop-<br>ular because they offer several beneﬁts over general anesthesia and<br>traditional systemic analgesia, including reduced risk of mortality<br>and less postoperative pain, thus facilitating early postoperative<br>mobilization of the limbs and consequently reducing the chances<br>of postoperative VTE [31,32]. Regional anesthesia is used in<br>millions of operations each year and, at a time when the use<br>of the direct OACs is growing, bleeding-related complications<br>could arise if appropriate guidance is not followed [33].

However, the incidence of spinal hematoma<br>increases with the presence of any risk factors, listed in Table 1,<br>and more so if heparin anticoagulation is accompanied by trau-<br>matic puncture (increasing incidence rates to 1 in 2000 and 1<br>in 2900 for epidural and spinal anesthesia, respectively).

Of the 13 cases of neuraxial hematoma reported<br>from a total of 1.4 million procedures involving neuraxial<br>central blocks, 10 were associated with thromboprophylaxis<br>(enoxaparin, dalteparin, or fondaparinux); however, for<br>6 of 10 of these occurrences, the time elapsed between<br>cessation/initiation of thromboprophylaxis and puncture may<br>not have been sufﬁcient to prevent a bleeding event [44]. A<br>recent retrospective study on the safety of epidural and spinal<br>neuraxial block showed that the incidence of perioperative<br>neurological complications in orthopedic patients was rela-<br>tively low (0.96/1000; 95% CI 0.77-1.16/1000), but was<br>higher than previously reported in other non-obstetric popula-<br>tions [45].

Patient-related factors increasing the risk of<br>spinal hematoma</p>\\n<p id=\\'35\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:18px\\'>Regarding patient-related factors, clinicians must exercise<br>particular care with elderly patients requiring surgical inter-<br>vention—these patients are at increased risk of thrombo-<br>embolic disorders [46,47] and are, therefore, more likely to<br>be receiving anticoagulants. Furthermore, the bleeding risk in<br>elderly patients receiving anticoagulants is augmented<br>[48,49]. Elderly patients are also more likely to have renal or he-<br>patic impairment, causing increased drug plasma concentrations,<br>and consequently drug elimination may be slower in these<br>patients [50]. Real-world data from the RIETE (Registro Infor-<br>matizado de Pacientes con Enfermedad TromboEmbólica)<br>registry have shown major and fatal bleeding to be more com-<br>mon in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy who were<br>aged ≥ 80 years compared with those aged b 80 years (3.4%<br>vs 2.1% and 0.8% vs 0.4%, respectively) [51]. Therefore,<br>knowledge about the metabolism of the direct OACs approved<br>for VTE prevention after major orthopedic surgery is essential<br>when deciding which anticoagulant to prescribe to a particular<br>patient. Whereas the metabolism of dabigatran is mostly<br>dependent on renal clearance, the metabolism of apixaban<br>and rivaroxaban involves multiple pathways and is less<br>dependent on renal function (Table 2). The high frequency of<br>co-medication use in elderly patients also increases both the<br>potential for drug-drug interactions and the risk of bleeding [52].</p>\\n<p id=\\'36\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>2.4.

With the overall aging of the population,<br>more patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery are likely<br>to be receiving anticoagulation therapy for thromboembolic<br>disorders prior to their surgical procedure. Several direct<br>OACs are currently approved for different therapeutic indica-<br>tions, including prevention of VTE after elective knee or hip<br>replacement surgery, and their use in clinical practice has been<br>growing. Effective management of these direct OACs and<br>regional anesthesia is essential to avoid bleeding complica-<br>tions and is, therefore, a topic of crucial interest for anesthesi-<br>ologists. Thromboprophylaxis with all direct OACs may start<br>between 1 and 24 hours after surgery [6,8,10], provided that<br>hemostasis has been achieved, and thus should present a lower<br>theoretical risk of bleeding or neuraxial hematoma in case of<br>central blocks, in comparison with preoperatively initiated<br>LMWH. After surgery, restarting direct OACs can be delayed<br>by up to 48 hours in cases of bleeding or a difﬁcult neuraxial<br>block, and protection against thromboembolic events is<br>achieved within hours after the ﬁrst dose of these agents and<br>without the need for bridging therapy. The effect of the type<br>of anesthesia on clinical outcomes of the direct OACs is still<br>unclear. Subanalyses of RE-MODEL, RE-NOVATE, and<br>RE-MOBILIZE data suggest that, irrespective of the anesthe-<br>sia used, neuraxial anesthesia was associated with a lower risk</p>\\n<header id=\\'109\\' style=\\'font-size:16px\\'>Anticoagulation and anesthesia</header>\\n<br><header id=\\'110\\' style=\\'font-size:16px\\'>233</header>\\n<p id=\\'111\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:16px\\'>of thromboembolic events and VTE-related mortality than<br>general anesthesia [63]. Conversely, a subanalysis of pooled<br>RECORD data found no signiﬁcant difference in the risk of<br>venous thromboembolic events between these types of<br>anesthesia used [62]. A growing body of clinical study and<br>real-world data, particularly with rivaroxaban, suggests that<br>neuraxial anesthesia can be undertaken in patients undergoing<br>major orthopedic surgery without increasing the risk of<br>compressive hematoma, provided that guideline recommenda-<br>tions are followed and bleeding risk is evaluated on an individ-<br>ual basis.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\'112\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>Acknowledgements</h1>\\n<p id=\\'113\\' data-category=\\'paragraph\\' style=\\'font-size:16px\\'>The authors would like to acknowledge Li Wan for<br>editorial support, with funding from Bayer HealthCare<br>Pharmaceuticals and Janssen Scientiﬁc Affairs, LLC.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\'114\\' style=\\'font-size:20px\\'>References</h1>\\n<p id=\\'115\\' data-category=\\'list\\' style=\\'font-size:14px\\'>[1] Deitelzweig SB, Johnson BH, Lin J, Schulman KL.

In Europe,\\nrivaroxaban is also indicated for co-administration with acetyl-\\nsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or\\nticlopidine for the prevention of atherothrombotic events after\\nacute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers\\n[10]. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct inhibitors of Factor\\nXa, whereas dabigatran is a direct inhibitor of thrombin.\\nAll three agents have been found to exhibit predictable\\npharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and have a fast\\nonset of action—reaching maximum plasma concentration\\nrapidly after oral administration (apixaban, 3-4 hours; rivarox-\\naban, 2-4 hours; dabigatran, 0.5-2.0 hours) [6,8,10,12–15].\\nThe half-lives of apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran are\\n~ 12 hours, 5-13 hours, and 11-14 hours, respectively\\n[6,8,10]. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacody-\\nnamic characteristics are not inﬂuenced to a clinically mean-\\ningful extent by body weight, age, or gender, which\\ncollectively indicate that these direct OACs can be given as\\nﬁxed dosing regimens without the need for routine coagulation\\nmonitoring [16–20]. The routes of drug elimination differ be-\\ntween the 2 drug classes: apixaban and rivaroxaban have mul-\\ntiple pathways including renal excretion (~ 27% and 66%\\n[33% as active drug and 33% after metabolic degradation], re-\\nspectively), whereas elimination of dabigatran is predominant-\\nly via the renal system (85%) [6,8,10,21]. In patients receiving\\ndabigatran for the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replace-\\nment surgery, a dose reduction is required in those with mod-\\nerate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL min−1),\\nthose aged 75 years or over, and those taking concomitant\\nmild-to-moderate P-glycoprotein inhibitors [8]. Owing to their\\nmode of action, all anticoagulants can increase the risk of\\nbleeding events. However, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabiga-\\ntran did not pose any signiﬁcantly increased risk of major\\nbleeding events compared with enoxaparin in phase III clinical\\ntrials in the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replacement\\nsurgery [22–30]. Despite the clinical evidence on the safety\\nand efﬁcacy proﬁle of direct OACs demonstrated in clinical trials,\\nphysicians—particularly anesthesiologists—need to be aware of\\nhow to minimize the risks of bleeding complications when treat-\\ning patients who are taking an anticoagulant and are due to under-\\ngo surgery with regional anesthesia.\\nRegional anesthesia techniques have become increasingly pop-\\nular because they offer several beneﬁts over general anesthesia and\\ntraditional systemic analgesia, including reduced risk of mortality\\nand less postoperative pain, thus facilitating early postoperative\\nmobilization of the limbs and consequently reducing the chances\\nof postoperative VTE [31,32]. Regional anesthesia is used in\\nmillions of operations each year and, at a time when the use\\nof the direct OACs is growing, bleeding-related complications\\ncould arise if appropriate guidance is not followed [33]. This\\nreview aims to provide anesthesiologists with an overview of\\ncurrent data on the risk of hemorrhagic complications with\\ndirect OACs when using regional anesthesia, particularly\\nin patients at a high risk of VTE, such as those undergoing\\nmajor orthopedic surgery. Moreover, current guideline\\nrecommendations will be discussed and best practice in speciﬁc\\nclinical situations, such as in patients with renal impairment who\\nare at an increased risk of bleeding, will be highlighted.\\n2. Regional anesthesia and complications\\nThe most common complications of regional anesthesia\\ninclude postdural puncture headache (occurs in 0.1%-36% of\\npatients but rarely lasts longer than 7 days) [34], backache (af-\\nfects up to 11% of patients in the 5 days after the procedure)\\n[35], and peripheral nerve damage (eg, transient paresthesia\\nis estimated in up to 8%-10% of patients in the immediate days\\nafter regional anesthesia) [36]. Serious complications, such as\\nspinal or epidural hematoma and epidural abscess, are rare and\\ntherefore difﬁcult to study in detail [37]. For peripheral nerve\\nblock, neurological complications are extremely rare, ranging\\nbetween 0.02% and 0.04% [38,39].\\n2.1. Risk factors associated with regional anesthesia\\nIn a systematic review of 141 studies (n = 9559),\\nneuraxial anesthesia was shown to be associated with lower\\nrates of mortality (2.1% vs 3.1%; odds ratio [OR] 0.7; 95%\\nconﬁdence interval [CI] 0.54-0.90; P = .006), occurrence of\\nDVT (odds reduction of 44%; OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.43-0.72;\\nP b .001) and PE (odds reduction of 55%; OR 0.45; 95% CI\\n0.29-0.69; P b .001), among other outcomes [31]. A more re-\\ncent observational study showed that neuraxial anesthesia was\\nassociated with a signiﬁcantly reduced need for blood transfu-\\nsions compared with patients receiving general anesthesia\\n(28.5% vs 44.7%; OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.45-0.61; P b .0001) af-\\nter simultaneous bilateral total knee replacement surgery [40].\\n2.2. Risk factors for the development of\\nspinal hematoma\\nThe overall incidences of hematoma in patients receiving\\nneuraxial anesthesia (epidural and spinal) have been estimated\\nto be as low as 1 in 220 000 and 1 in 320 000, respectively, in\\nthe absence of traumatic puncture and without the use of hep-\\narin or ASA [41]. However, the incidence of spinal hematoma\\nincreases with the presence of any risk factors, listed in Table 1,\\nand more so if heparin anticoagulation is accompanied by trau-\\nmatic puncture (increasing incidence rates to 1 in 2000 and 1\\nin 2900 for epidural and spinal anesthesia, respectively). For\\nASA therapy the risk is 1 in 8500 and 1 in 12 000 for epidural\\nand spinal anesthesia, respectively [41,42]. An incidence of\\nbetween 1 in 1000 and 1 in 10 000 has been estimated for neur-\\naxial hematoma after central neural blockade in patients under-\\ngoing orthopedic procedures and receiving preoperative\\nthromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin [43]. A recent review\\nassessing spinal/epidural anesthesia complications in Finland\\nfrom 2000 to 2009 showed the risk of developing a serious\\ncomplication (deﬁned as a potentially fatal event or an event\\nof over 1 year in duration, including epidural hematoma) after\\n226\\nG.

Of the 13 cases of neuraxial hematoma reported\\nfrom a total of 1.4 million procedures involving neuraxial\\ncentral blocks, 10 were associated with thromboprophylaxis\\n(enoxaparin, dalteparin, or fondaparinux); however, for\\n6 of 10 of these occurrences, the time elapsed between\\ncessation/initiation of thromboprophylaxis and puncture may\\nnot have been sufﬁcient to prevent a bleeding event [44]. A\\nrecent retrospective study on the safety of epidural and spinal\\nneuraxial block showed that the incidence of perioperative\\nneurological complications in orthopedic patients was rela-\\ntively low (0.96/1000; 95% CI 0.77-1.16/1000), but was\\nhigher than previously reported in other non-obstetric popula-\\ntions [45]. Risk factors associated with an increased risk of\\nclinically signiﬁcant bleeding causing spinal hematoma can\\nbe divided into patient-, drug-, and procedure-related catego-\\nries (Table 1).\\n2.3. Patient-related factors increasing the risk of\\nspinal hematoma\\nRegarding patient-related factors, clinicians must exercise\\nparticular care with elderly patients requiring surgical inter-\\nvention—these patients are at increased risk of thrombo-\\nembolic disorders [46,47] and are, therefore, more likely to\\nbe receiving anticoagulants. Furthermore, the bleeding risk in\\nelderly patients receiving anticoagulants is augmented\\n[48,49]. Elderly patients are also more likely to have renal or he-\\npatic impairment, causing increased drug plasma concentrations,\\nand consequently drug elimination may be slower in these\\npatients [50]. Real-world data from the RIETE (Registro Infor-\\nmatizado de Pacientes con Enfermedad TromboEmbólica)\\nregistry have shown major and fatal bleeding to be more com-\\nmon in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy who were\\naged ≥ 80 years compared with those aged b 80 years (3.4%\\nvs 2.1% and 0.8% vs 0.4%, respectively) [51]. Therefore,\\nknowledge about the metabolism of the direct OACs approved\\nfor VTE prevention after major orthopedic surgery is essential\\nwhen deciding which anticoagulant to prescribe to a particular\\npatient. Whereas the metabolism of dabigatran is mostly\\ndependent on renal clearance, the metabolism of apixaban\\nand rivaroxaban involves multiple pathways and is less\\ndependent on renal function (Table 2). The high frequency of\\nco-medication use in elderly patients also increases both the\\npotential for drug-drug interactions and the risk of bleeding [52].\\n2.4. Drug-related factors increasing the risk of\\nspinal hematoma\\nSome drug interactions of anticoagulants might increase the\\nrisk of bleeding complications, including the risk of spinal hema-\\ntoma. The direct OACs have fewer drug-drug and drug-food\\nTable 2 Pharmacokinetic characteristics of direct oral anticoagulants as per their Summary of Product Characteristics [6,8,10]\\nApixaban Rivaroxaban Dabigatran\\n Bioavailability ~ 50% for doses up to 10 mg 80%-100% (for 10 mg dose and for 15 mg and 20 mg doses taken with food) ~ 7%\\n Time to peak activity 3-4 h 2-4 h 0.5-2.0 h\\n Half-life ~ 12 h 5-9 h (young individuals) to 11-13 h (elderly individuals) 11-14 h\\n Renal elimination ~ 27% 33% as active drug (direct renal excretion) and 33% after metabolic degradation 85%\\n Pharmacokinetic interactions Strong inhibitors/inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp Strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp; strong CYP3A4 inducers Strong P-gp inhibitors and inducers\\nCYP3A4 = cytochrome P450 3A4; P-gp = P-glycoprotein.\\nAnticoagulation and anesthesia\\n227\\ninteractions compared with vitamin K antagonists. The most\\nsigniﬁcant interactions are those of apixaban and rivaroxaban\\nwith systemic co-administration of strong inhibitors of both cyto-\\nchrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (such as the azole-\\nantimycotics ketoconazole and itraconazole and the HIV protease\\ninhibitor ritonavir), which is not recommended [6,10], and\\ndabigatran with amiodarone and verapamil that requires a\\nreduction in the daily dose [8]. For all 3 direct OACs, care\\nshould be taken when co-administering with non-steroidal\\nanti-inﬂammatory drugs, ASA, or platelet aggregation inhibi-\\ntors, which may increase bleeding risk [6,10].\\n2.5. Procedural-related factors increasing the risk of\\nspinal hematoma\\nThe risk of spinal hematoma has also been associated with\\nprocedural factors, including unintentional needle/catheter-\\nrelated mechanical damage of neural or vascular components\\nof the spine due to a difﬁcult or traumatic spinal procedure\\n[53–55]. The patient characteristics also have an inﬂuence\\non procedure-related risk factors; for example, aging is associ-\\nated with skeletal degeneration that may make the anesthesia\\nprocedure technically more difﬁcult [56].\\n3. Inﬂuence of anesthesia in patients receiving\\ndirect oral anticoagulants: evidence from\\nphase III clinical studies with a focus on\\nmajor orthopedic surgery\\nGiven the increasing utilization of direct OACs for the\\ntreatment and prevention of thromboembolic disorders, it is\\ncrucial to evaluate the risk of compressive hematoma and the\\nimpact on clinical outcomes when regional anesthesia is used.\\nTo discuss the effect of regional anesthesia on the risk of com-\\npressive hematoma and bleeding risk, we searched PubMed\\nwith no date restrictions for phase III clinical trials comparing\\n‘apixaban’, ‘rivaroxaban’, or ‘dabigatran’ with ‘standard of\\ncare’/‘low molecular weight heparin’ for ‘VTE prevention’/\\n‘thromboprophylaxis’ after ‘total knee or hip replacement\\nsurgery’/‘knee or hip arthroplasty’ and for studies investigating\\n‘spinal hematoma’ after ‘regional anesthesia’.\\nIt is worth noting the risk of spinal hematoma with regional\\nanesthesia when receiving traditional anticoagulants. Vitamin\\nK antagonist therapy is a contraindication for neuraxial\\nanesthesia, owing to the high risk of bleeding associated with\\ntherapeutic doses [57]. The risk of spinal hematoma in patients\\nreceiving low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) concomi-\\ntantly with epidural anesthesia is reported to be 1:6600 for\\nsingle-shot epidural and 1:3100 with an indwelling catheter\\nfor the LMWH dosage of 30 mg twice daily and 1:18 000\\nfor a 40 mg once-daily dosage [57,58]. There are fewer data\\nfor ASA, but it has been demonstrated that medical patients\\nreceiving daily doses above 100 mg are at increased risk of\\nhemorrhagic complications [59].\\nCentral nerve blocks have been classiﬁed as a high bleed-\\ning risk procedure owing to their rare but severe complication,\\neg, spinal-epidural hematoma [60,61]. Because of the absence\\nof evidence-based data, when neuraxial procedures are\\nperformed in these conditions, a systematic follow-up of these\\npatients and a heightened awareness of bleeding complications\\nshould be observed.\\n3.1. Apixaban\\nStudies speciﬁcally designed to investigate the relationship\\nbetween anesthesia and spinal hematoma risk in patients\\nreceiving apixaban are lacking. However, phase III clinical\\ntrials comparing apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily) with subcuta-\\nneous enoxaparin (30 mg twice daily or 40 mg once daily)\\nfor VTE prevention after total knee or hip replacement surgery\\nfound that apixaban was as effective as or better than enoxa-\\nparin at reducing the risk of the composite of VTE or death\\nwith similar or lower rates of bleeding [22–24]. In these 3\\ntrials, 15.8% of patients randomized to apixaban had regional\\nanesthesia. Experience of apixaban use in the presence of\\nneuraxial blockade is limited and, according to its product label\\nand guidance from the European Society of Anaesthesiology\\n(ESA), should only be done with extreme caution [6,57].\\n3.2. Rivaroxaban\\nThe incidences of intraspinal bleeding or hemorrhagic\\npuncture were included under the deﬁnition for major bleed-\\ning used in the RECORD (REgulation of Coagulation in\\nORthopaedic surgery to prevent Deep vein thrombosis and\\npulmonary embolism) clinical trial program of rivaroxaban\\n[27,62]. A post hoc analysis assessed 12 729 randomized\\npatients in the pooled RECORD1-4 program undergoing elec-\\ntive total knee or hip replacement surgery for events related to\\nneuraxial anesthesia, such as neuraxial hematoma [62].\\nThromboprophylactic therapy was provided to patients as\\neither oral rivaroxaban (10 mg once daily, initiated 6-8 hours\\nafter surgery) or subcutaneous enoxaparin (40 mg once daily,\\nstarted 12 hours prior to surgery, or 30 mg twice daily, started\\n12-24 hours after surgery) [62]. Although 66% of patients\\n(safety population, n = 12 383) received neuraxial anesthesia\\n(9% of patients also received general anesthesia), only 1\\ncompressive hematoma after epidural catheter removal was\\nrecorded. This event occurred after elective total knee replace-\\nment surgery in a patient treated with enoxaparin, who was at\\nincreased risk of bleeding as a result of advanced age and renal\\ninsufﬁciency. The patient was adequately managed with a\\nlaminectomy without further bleeding or neurological\\ncomplications [62]. The type of anesthesia (spinal with or\\nwithout general anesthesia, epidural, epidural with indwelling\\ncatheter, general or spinal with femoral block, or general\\nalone) had no inﬂuence on the rates of total venous thrombo-\\nembolic events, which were lower with rivaroxaban than with\\nstandard of care [62].\\n228\\nG. Cappelleri, A. Fanelli\\nIn the RECORD post hoc subanalysis, the incidence of total\\nvenous thromboembolic events (the composite of any DVT,\\nnon-fatal PE, and all-cause mortality) and safety proﬁles were\\nsimilar irrespective of the type of anesthesia used. Neuraxial\\nanesthesia was associated with a slightly lower rate of\\nsymptomatic thromboembolic events compared with general\\nanesthesia in patients undergoing elective total knee or hip\\nreplacement surgery [62]. However, available experience\\nusing rivaroxaban with neuraxial blockade remains limited,\\nand real risk is difﬁcult to evaluate owing to the low incidences\\nof spinal and epidural hematoma in this setting. The ESA\\nguidelines, published before the completion of the relevant\\nRECORD subanalysis, recommend extreme caution when\\nusing rivaroxaban with neuraxial blockade [57]. The\\nAmerican Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine\\n(ASRA) guidelines for dabigatran, as well as rivaroxaban,\\nare still being evaluated. These guidelines do not provide\\ndetailed information for the management of anticoagulation\\nwith direct OACs owing to a lack of available information\\non block performance [41].\\n3.3. Dabigatran\\nAn analysis of the pooled population of patients from the\\nphase III RE-MODEL, RE-NOVATE, and RE-MOBILIZE\\nstudies who underwent major hip or knee replacement surgery\\nand received thromboprophylaxis with dabigatran (220 mg or\\n150 mg once daily) or enoxaparin showed a higher use of neur-\\naxial anesthesia (n = 4212; 52%) compared with general anes-\\nthesia (n = 2311; 29%) or combination anesthesia, namely,\\nneuraxial or general anesthesia combined with a peripheral\\nnerve block (n = 1539; 19%) [63]. The use of neuraxial anes-\\nthesia was not associated with neuraxial hematoma—no cases\\nwere reported [63]. The efﬁcacy and safety outcomes of the\\ndabigatran groups did not differ from those of the standard\\ntherapy groups, and were not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the\\ntype of anesthesia used [63]. A reduced incidence of major\\nVTE and VTE-related mortality was observed with neuraxial\\nanesthesia compared with general anesthesia (4.2% vs 3.1%;\\nOR 1.40; 95% CI 1.03-1.90; P = .035) in the overall population,\\nbut no signiﬁcant differences or clear trends were recorded\\nregarding the safety outcomes of major bleeding or major\\nand non-major clinically relevant bleeding between the types\\nof anesthesia [63]. Experience with combined use of neuraxial\\nblockade and dabigatran is restricted by its manufacturer's\\nadvice against this, as stated by the ESA guidelines [8,57].\\n4. Management of direct oral anticoagulants and\\nneuraxial anesthesia in major orthopedic surgery\\nManagement strategies must balance the surgical risk of\\nhematoma in the anesthetized patient with effective thrombo-\\nprophylaxis. Understanding the pharmacodynamic and\\npharmacokinetic properties of an anticoagulant and the inﬂu-\\nence of patient age and hepatic and renal function is essential.\\nProviding neuraxial anesthesia and the timing of needle/catheter\\ninsertion/removal in patients who are receiving or are to receive\\nanticoagulant therapy involves individual assessment of the\\nrisks and beneﬁts of such a procedure, together with rigorous\\nmanagement of anticoagulation activity and monitoring for\\nsigns of neurological dysfunction. It is of the utmost importance\\nto ensure that the anticoagulation effect is adequately reduced\\nbefore proceeding with a neuraxial block. It is possible to\\nmeasure the effect of the direct OACs either qualitatively or\\nquantitatively, if required.\\n4.1. Perioperative management of direct\\noral anticoagulants\\nAdequate protocols for interrupting and resuming thrombo-\\nprophylaxis based on the pharmacokinetic properties of the direct\\nOACs are essential. Clinical practice guidelines, such as those of\\nthe ESA [57]), ASRA [41], and the Scandinavian Society of\\nAnaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (SSAI) [64], pro-\\nvide recommendations for the regional anesthetic management\\nof patients undergoing surgery and requiring anticoagulation,\\nincluding with direct OACs (Table 3). These recommenda-\\ntions, based on data from clinical trials, the pharmacokinetic\\nproﬁle of each anticoagulant, and from clinical experience, ad-\\nvise a waiting time between interrupting anticoagulation and\\nperforming neuraxial blockade that depends on the elimination\\nhalf-life of the anticoagulant agent [57]. The percentages of\\ndrug remaining in the circulation after 1-6 half-lives are\\n50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.3%, 3.1%, and 1.6%, respectively [65].\\nA recommendation for a waiting period of 2 half-lives, to re-\\nduce the bioavailability of an anticoagulant to less than 25%,\\ndoes not take into consideration how the half-life elimination\\nof a drug is inﬂuenced by patient characteristics. Patients\\nwho undergo joint replacement surgery are typically elderly,\\noften with renal impairment and receiving antiplatelet therapy;\\nfor these patients, a waiting time of 3-5 half-lives could be\\nmore appropriate if hemostatic safety is not assured (Table 4).\\nTo prevent VTE after major orthopedic surgery, the direct\\nOACs have to be administered in the postoperative period\\nwhen adequate hemostasis has been established, as determined\\nby the treating physician.\\nRecently, the direct OACs have been approved for long-term\\nprevention of thromboembolic events in non-valvular AF, and\\nfor the treatment and secondary prophylaxis of VTE. Every\\nyear, 15%-20% of patients receiving therapeutic doses of anti-\\ncoagulants require perioperative temporary interruption, and\\nthe characteristics of both the patients and the procedures should\\nbe considered when scheduling interruption and resumption.\\n4.1.1.

However, if required, the recommendation\\nprovided by the Summary of Product Characteristics is to wait\\n20-30 hours (considering 2 times its elimination half-life) be-\\ntween interruption of anticoagulation therapy and neuraxial\\npuncture/catheter removal, with at least 1 dose being omitted\\n[6,66]. The ESA recommends 26-30 hours between stopping\\nanticoagulation and conducting a neuraxial anesthesia proce-\\ndure for management of anticoagulation with apixaban in the\\ncontext of elective orthopedic surgery [57].\\n4.1.1.2. Resumption of apixaban after surgery. The Sum-\\nmary of Product Characteristics of apixaban recommends start-\\ning thromboprophylaxis 12-24 hours after the end of surgery,\\nprovided hemostasis is achieved and allowing for a waiting\\nperiod of at least 5 hours to re-initiate treatment after catheter\\nremoval [6]. The ESA recommends 4-6 hours between cathe-\\nter removal and initiation of anticoagulation, for management\\nof anticoagulation with apixaban in the context of elective\\northopedic surgery [57]. No further recommendations were\\nprovided by the ASRA for management of anticoagulation\\nwith apixaban in the context of elective orthopedic surgery\\n[41]. The SSAI guidelines state that the lack of data prevents\\nany recommendation being made regarding the use of apixa-\\nban and central neuraxial block, although a period of 6 hours\\nshould be observed between central neuraxial block or catheter\\nmanipulation and ﬁrst dose of this anticoagulant [64].\\n4.1.2. Perioperative management of rivaroxaban\\n4.1.2.1. Interruption of rivaroxaban before surgery. The\\nSummary of Product Characteristics of rivaroxaban suggest\\nin patients with normal renal function a minimum of 24 hours\\nbetween the last therapeutic dose of the anticoagulant and the\\nstart of the surgery [10]. For patients with severe renal impair-\\nment, many authors recommend an interval of up to 4-5 days\\n[60,67,68]. Imberti et al suggested a discontinuation of rivar-\\noxaban at least 48 hours prior to procedures involving a\\nstandard risk of bleeding, such as orthopedic surgery; for\\nprocedures with a high risk of bleeding (neuraxial block),\\nrivaroxaban should be stopped 72 hours before the intervention\\n[69]. In the authors' opinion, patients with AF with standard\\nbleeding risk (HAS-BLED score b 3) could undergo neuraxial\\nanesthesia 48 hours after the last rivaroxaban intake, whereas\\nin patients with high bleeding risk, neuraxial anesthesia should\\nbe delayed for 4 days, and this type of anesthesia should not be\\nconsidered in cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine\\nclearance b 30 mL min−1) [69].\\nIn patients receiving ongoing rivaroxaban, if a central block\\nwith an indwelling catheter is used, the SSAI guidelines\\nrecommend a minimum of 18 hours between the last dose of\\nrivaroxaban and removal of an indwelling catheter [64].\\nBecause of the prolongation of the half-life in elderly patients,\\nthe ESA guidelines recommend a longer interval (22-26 hours)\\nbetween the last dose of rivaroxaban and removal of an\\nindwelling catheter [57]. These 2 recommendations are in\\nagreement with those in the report by Rosencher et al, which\\nrecommends 2 half-lives between rivaroxaban discontinuation\\nand epidural catheter removal [66]. Furthermore, these guide-\\nlines highlight the fact that patients receiving anti-hemostatic\\ndrugs and with impaired drug elimination, such as those with\\nrenal impairment, may require waiting times to be prolonged\\n[64]. The ASRA guidelines issued for rivaroxaban recom-\\nmend a cautious approach owing to the lack of information\\non the speciﬁcs (needle placement or catheter management)\\nof block performance and the prolonged half-life in elderly pa-\\ntients resulting from deterioration of renal function, even in the\\nabsence of any reported spinal hematoma [41].\\n4.1.2.2. Resumption of rivaroxaban after surgery. Rivar-\\noxaban should be started 6-10 hours after the end of surgery,\\nprovided hemostasis is achieved [10]. The SSAI guidelines\\nrecommend a minimum of 6 hours between central neuraxial\\nblock and initiation of rivaroxaban, or a delay of 24 hours if\\na traumatic puncture occurred during the performance of\\ncentral nerve block [10,64]. The ESA recommends an interval\\nTable 4 Half-lives of direct oral anticoagulant drugs and recommended interval between discontinuation and surgery or neuraxial procedure, set as 2-3 half-lives or 4-5 half-lives depending\\non the bleeding risk of the surgical procedure and the level of anticoagulant effect permitted at surgery [65,67,68].\\nDrug Variation of elimination half-life values (h) a [65] Bleeding risk of surgical procedure Anticoagulant residual effect at surgery\\n Low bleeding risk surgery (2-3 half-lives) [67] Days between last dose and surgery [67] High bleeding risk surgery (4-5 half-lives) [67] Days between last dose and surgery [67] Mild to moderate anticoagulant effect (2-3 half-lives) [68] Days between last dose and surgery [68] No or minimal anticoagulant effect (4-5 half-lives) [68] Days between last dose and surgery [68]\\n Apixaban 15 CrCl N 50 mL min−1 b 2 d CrCl N 50 mL min−1 3 d CrCl N 50 mL min−1 2 d CrCl N 50 mL min−1 3 d\\n CrCl 30-50 mL min−1 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min−1 4 d CrCl 30-50 mL min−1 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min−1 4-5 d\\n Rivaroxaban 5-13 CrCl N 50 mL min−1 c 2 d CrCl N 50 mL min−1 3 d CrCl N 50 mL min−1 2 d CrCl N 50 mL min−1 3 d\\n CrCl 30-50 mL min−1 2 d CrCl 30-50 mL min−1 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min−1 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min−1 4-5 d\\n CrCl 15-29.9 mL min−1 3 d CrCl 15-29.9 mL min−1 4 d    \\n Dabigatran 12-17; CrCl N 50 mL min−1 e 2 d CrCl N 50 mL min−1 3 d CrCl N 50 mL min−1 2 d CrCl N 50 mL min−1 3 d\\n 28 d CrCl 30-50 mL min−1 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min−1 4-5 d CrCl 30-50 mL min−1 3 d CrCl 30-50 mL min−1 4-5 d\\nCrCl = creatinine clearance.\\na Half-lives differ from those in the Summary of Product Characteristics of each agent.\\nb Apixaban (5 mg twice daily) half-life for CrCl N 50 mL min−1 and CrCl 30-50 mL min−1 considered as 7-8 and 17-18 hours, respectively.\\nc Rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) half-life for CrCl N 50 mL min−1, CrCl 30-50 mL min−1 and CrCl 15-29 mL min−1 considered as 8-9, 9 and 9-10.5 hours, respectively.\\nd End-stage renal disease.\\ne Dabigatran (150 mg twice daily) half-life for CrCl N 50 mL min−1 and CrCl 30-50 mL min−1 considered as 14-17 and 16-18 hours, respectively.\\nG.\\nCappelleri,\\nA.\\nFanelli\\n231\\nAnticoagulation and anesthesia\\nof 4-6 hours between epidural catheter removal and the next\\ndose of rivaroxaban [57].

Interruption of dabigatran before surgery.\\ndabigatran Summary of Product Characteristics recommends\\ndiscontinuation of the anticoagulant for ≥ 2 days before elec-\\ntive surgery that carries a high risk of bleeding or is considered\\nto be ‘major’ surgery, depending on the patient's renal\\nfunction [8]. High-risk procedures, including cardiac surgery,\\nneurosurgery, abdominal surgery, or procedures requiring\\nspinal anesthesia, may require cessation of dabigatran 2-4 days\\nbefore surgery in patients with normal renal function and ≥ 4\\ndays before surgery in patients with moderate renal impair-\\nment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL min− 1) [70]. Based on\\nthe pharmacokinetic characteristics of dabigatran, a time inter-\\nval of 36 hours (skipping 1 dose) between the last dose of dabi-\\ngatran and puncture/catheter removal is suggested [66], but\\nthis has not been studied or conﬁrmed.\\n4.1.3.2. Resumption of dabigatran after surgery. Pro-\\nvided hemostasis is achieved, dabigatran should be started 1-4\\nhours after the end of surgery [8]. The ESA guidelines recom-\\nmend against the use of dabigatran in the presence of neuraxial\\nblockade, as also advised in the dabigatran Summary of\\nProduct Characteristics [8]. If neuraxial anesthesia is used,\\nthe ﬁrst dose of dabigatran should not be administered within\\n2 hours of catheter removal, in accordance with the Summary\\nof Product Characteristics [8]. The ESA guidelines recom-\\nmend a waiting time of 6 hours after catheter removal before\\nre-initiating anticoagulation with dabigatran [57]. However,\\nthe ASRA guidelines state simply that caution must be taken\\nowing to the paucity of information on the performance of\\nneuraxial block and the prolonged half-life of this anticoagu-\\nlant after multiple doses or in patients with renal impairment,\\ndespite the absence of spinal hematomas reported up to the\\npublication of these guidelines [41]. The SSAI guidelines\\nmake the sole recommendation of waiting for at least 6 hours\\nafter a central neuraxial block or catheter removal before\\nthe ﬁrst dose of dabigatran is taken [64]. However, based on\\nthe pharmacokinetic characteristics of dabigatran, it may be\\nprudent to wait at least 12 hours after catheter removal before\\nadministration of dabigatran [66].\\n4.2. Laboratory measurement of direct\\noral anticoagulants\\nIn the context of perioperative management of patients who\\nare receiving a direct OAC, the concentration of the direct\\nOAC can be determined if, for example, an emergency\\nsurgical intervention is required by an anticoagulated patient.\\nHowever, it is important to take into account the timing of\\nthe last dose in relation to blood sampling time when interpreting\\nthe test results [71].\\n4.2.1. Laboratory measurement of apixaban\\nThe quantitative measurement of plasma concentrations of\\napixaban can be performed using anti-Factor Xa chromogenic\\nassays and adequate standard calibration curves [72].\\nAlthough apixaban prolongs prothrombin time (PT), it is not\\nsuitable for measuring the anticoagulant effect of apixaban\\nand there is no known relationship with bleeding risk [71].\\n4.2.2. Laboratory measurement of rivaroxaban\\nThe PT can be used to determine the relative anticoagulant\\nactivity of rivaroxaban [71,73]. However, PT is not speciﬁc\\nand can be inﬂuenced by factors such as cancer, hepatic\\nimpairment, and vitamin K deﬁciency [74,75]. Furthermore,\\nthere is marked variability in the sensitivity of the reagents\\navailable for obtaining PT results for rivaroxaban; only a\\nsensitive reagent, such as Neoplastin Plus (Diagnostica Stago,\\nAsnières-sur-Seine, France), should be used [76]. Importantly,\\nthe international normalized ratio must not be used for rivarox-\\naban. The quantitative measurement of plasma concentrations\\nof rivaroxaban can be performed using anti-Factor Xa\\nchromogenic assays (eg, STA Rotachrom, Diagnostica Stago,\\nAsnières-sur-Seine, France) with validated calibrators [77].\\nWhen anti-Factor Xa assays are unavailable, a PT test with a\\nreagent sensitive to rivaroxaban may be used to conﬁrm the\\nabsence or presence of an anticoagulant effect (if the sampling\\ntime after last tablet intake is known) [76,78,79].\\n4.2.3. Laboratory measurement of dabigatran\\nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay, for\\nexample, provides a qualitative measure of the anticoagulant\\neffect of dabigatran [73]. Unfortunately, aPTT is inﬂuenced\\nby the coagulometers and reagents used [75]. In the case of\\naPTT results for dabigatran, there is reasonable agreement\\nregardless of the reagent composition, and results are within\\n10% of reference measurements [70]. The aPTT assay may be\\nuseful in dabigatran-treated patients who require emergency\\ninterventions to exclude any clinically relevant dabigatran\\nanticoagulant effect [71,80]. The ecarin clotting time (ECT)\\nassay provides a direct measurement of the activity of dabiga-\\ntran, but is not readily available [71]. Calibrated ecarin chro-\\nmogenic assays are also available (eg, Ecarin Chromogenic\\nAssay, Diagnostica Stago, Asnières-sur-Seine, France) and\\nmay allow faster ECT measurements than the ECT assay\\n[71]. Direct thrombin inhibitor assays (such as the\\nHEMOCLOT assay, HYPHEN BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise,\\nFrance) can be used for the quantitative measurement of\\nplasma concentrations of dabigatran [81]. In the absence of\\nthis assay, an aPTT test can be used [82].\\n5. Neurological complications and\\nregional anesthesia\\nDevelopment of neurological complications is a major con-\\ncern in cases of regional anesthesia in patients receiving direct\\n232\\nG. Cappelleri, A. Fanelli\\nOACs (eg, for stroke prevention). Assessment of neurological\\nfunction is the most reliable method for detecting neurological\\ninjury, because standard laboratory tests may not provide ade-\\nquate information about the coagulation status of a patient\\n[83,84]. Monitoring of neurological function during regional\\nanesthesia alongside anticoagulant therapy is essential—but\\nmay not be sufﬁcient—to improve neurological outcomes.\\nBased on the pharmacokinetic properties of the direct OACs\\nand their rapid onset of action (within a few hours), conﬁning\\nthe assessment of neurological function to the period between\\ncatheter removal or neuraxial puncture and 4 hours after\\nthe initiation of therapy may seem reasonable. However, a\\nlonger period of time during which neurological function\\nshould be assessed may be required, because the development\\nof neurological injury may be slow, with the onset of\\nneurological symptoms potentially taking as long as 3 or more\\ndays [55].\\n6. Use of non-neuraxial regional techniques and\\ndirect oral anticoagulants in clinical practice\\nTotal knee and hip replacement surgery causes intense\\npostoperative pain, which may impair rehabilitation and mobi-\\nlization, prolong hospitalization, and increase the risk of VTE\\n[85]. The use of continuous peripheral nerve blocks (femoral\\nand lumbar plexus blocks) for hip and knee surgery may offer\\nadvantages as a ﬁrst strategy to balance the risk of hematoma\\nin anticoagulated patients compared with epidural analgesia.\\nThe results from a systematic review of randomized controlled\\ntrials support the use of peripheral nerve blocks as a ﬁrst\\nchoice of analgesia after major orthopedic surgery; femoral\\nnerve block provided a similar analgesic proﬁle to epidural\\nanalgesia, with fewer side-effects after total knee replacement sur-\\ngery [86]. Lumbar plexus block represents the ﬁrst analgesic\\nchoice after total hip replacement surgery [87]. However, both\\nlumbar plexus and femoral nerve blocks are still associated\\nwith loss of quadricep muscle strength [88,89]. A study has\\nsuggested that an adductor canal block after knee surgery\\nmay provide a similar analgesic proﬁle but without quadricep\\nweakness after total knee replacement surgery [88]. Although\\nno difference was observed between the 2 anesthesia tech-\\nniques in terms of morphine use or level of pain, quadricep\\nstrength was signiﬁcantly better preserved with an adductor\\ncanal block than with a femoral nerve block (52% median of\\nbaseline vs 18%, P = .004) [88]. Peripheral nerve blocks have\\nbeen associated with a potential for wound hematoma with\\nadministration of heparin in some studies [57,90–93] but not\\nothers [94]. The potential severity of a hematoma in a non-\\ncompressible site and the lack of evidence on which to base\\nrecommendations for the particular use of continuous periph-\\neral nerve blocks have led the ESA and ASRA guidelines to\\nsuggest expanding the clinical recommendations for neuraxial\\nanesthesia to deeper peripheral nerve blocks, such as lumbar\\nplexus [41,57].\\nStudies speciﬁcally investigating the use of apixaban after\\nnon-neuraxial blocks in orthopedic surgery seem to be lacking.\\nHowever, there are some available data for rivaroxaban\\nand dabigatran. In a prospective observational study of 504\\npatients undergoing total knee replacement surgery who had\\ncontinuous femoral nerve block and whose femoral catheter\\nwas removed 20 hours after starting rivaroxaban (10 mg once\\ndaily), no incidences of hematoma causing neurovascular\\ncompromise at the femoral catheter site or groin area were\\nreported [95]. Neither was rivaroxaban associated with an\\nincrease in major bleeding in an observational analysis of\\n766 patients undergoing total knee or hip replacement surgery\\nand femoral, sciatic, and lumbar plexus blocks, although 3\\nhematomas in the operated knee requiring surgical evacuation\\nwere noted during rivaroxaban administration [96].\\nIn a post hoc pooled analysis of 3 phase III clinical trials of\\ndabigatran (220 mg or 150 mg once daily) versus enoxaparin\\nfor VTE prevention after knee or hip replacement surgery, in\\nwhich 19% (n = 1539) received a combination of general anes-\\nthesia or neuraxial anesthesia plus peripheral nerve block, rates\\nof major VTE and VTE-related mortality were slightly higher\\nwith general anesthesia compared with neuraxial or combina-\\ntion anesthesia, although not signiﬁcantly so, and neither were\\nthere signiﬁcant differences in efﬁcacy or safety outcomes\\nbetween dabigatran and enoxaparin [63].\\n7. Conclusions\\nPatients undergoing elective major orthopedic surgery\\nreceive thromboprophylaxis because of their increased risk\\nof developing VTE. With the overall aging of the population,\\nmore patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery are likely\\nto be receiving anticoagulation therapy for thromboembolic\\ndisorders prior to their surgical procedure. Several direct\\nOACs are currently approved for different therapeutic indica-\\ntions, including prevention of VTE after elective knee or hip\\nreplacement surgery, and their use in clinical practice has been\\ngrowing. Effective management of these direct OACs and\\nregional anesthesia is essential to avoid bleeding complica-\\ntions and is, therefore, a topic of crucial interest for anesthesi-\\nologists. Thromboprophylaxis with all direct OACs may start\\nbetween 1 and 24 hours after surgery [6,8,10], provided that\\nhemostasis has been achieved, and thus should present a lower\\ntheoretical risk of bleeding or neuraxial hematoma in case of\\ncentral blocks, in comparison with preoperatively initiated\\nLMWH. After surgery, restarting direct OACs can be delayed\\nby up to 48 hours in cases of bleeding or a difﬁcult neuraxial\\nblock, and protection against thromboembolic events is\\nachieved within hours after the ﬁrst dose of these agents and\\nwithout the need for bridging therapy. The effect of the type\\nof anesthesia on clinical outcomes of the direct OACs is still\\nunclear. Subanalyses of RE-MODEL, RE-NOVATE, and\\nRE-MOBILIZE data suggest that, irrespective of the anesthe-\\nsia used, neuraxial anesthesia was associated with a lower risk\\nAnticoagulation and anesthesia\\n233\\nof thromboembolic events and VTE-related mortality than\\ngeneral anesthesia [63]. Conversely, a subanalysis of pooled\\nRECORD data found no signiﬁcant difference in the risk of\\nvenous thromboembolic events between these types of\\nanesthesia used [62]. A growing body of clinical study and\\nreal-world data, particularly with rivaroxaban, suggests that\\nneuraxial anesthesia can be undertaken in patients undergoing\\nmajor orthopedic surgery without increasing the risk of\\ncompressive hematoma, provided that guideline recommenda-\\ntions are followed and bleeding risk is evaluated on an individ-\\nual basis.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Li Wan for\\neditorial support, with funding from Bayer HealthCare\\nPharmaceuticals and Janssen Scientiﬁc Affairs, LLC.\\nReferences\\n[1] Deitelzweig SB, Johnson BH, Lin J, Schulman KL.

Introduction\\n\\n\\nAbstract The use of direct oral anticoagulants including apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran, which are\\napproved for several therapeutic indications, can simplify perioperative and postoperative management\\nof anticoagulation. Utilization of regional neuraxial anesthesia in patients receiving anticoagulants carries\\na relatively small risk of hematoma, the serious complications of which must be acknowledged. Given\\nthe extensive use of regional anesthesia in surgery and the increasing number of patients receiving direct oral\\nanticoagulants, it is crucial to understand the current clinical data on the risk of hemorrhagic complications in\\nthis setting, particularly for anesthesiologists. We discuss current data, guideline recommendations, and best\\npractice advice on effective management of the direct oral anticoagulants and regional anesthesia, including\\nin specific clinical situations, such as patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery at high risk of a thromboembolic\\nevent, or patients with renal impairment at an increased risk of bleeding.\\n© 2016 The Authors.
